Mobile phone networks, power lines and trees were toppled and most roads were cut off.\n  \"Almost all houses were destroyed, many are totally damaged.\u00a0 Only a few are left standing, but with partial damage,\" said Major Rey Balido, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, adding that severed communication links made it hard to fix casualties.\u00a0\n  In the island province of Capiz, at least\u00a0six people were killed and\u00a010 missing, according to the provincial disaster response agency.\n  As much as 90 percent\u00a0of the houses and buildings in the province\u00a0were also destroyed, according to national media.\n  About a million people took shelter in 37 provinces after President Benigno Aquino appealed to those in the typhoon's path to leave vulnerable areas.\n  Philippine Red Cross chief Gwendolyn Pang told the AFP news agency that one of their top priorities was trying to re-establish contact or reach communities\u00a0on the eastern islands of\u00a0Leyte and Samar.\n  Leyte has been hit hard by the storm. Al Jazeera's Marga Ortigas, reporting from the capital, Manila, said \"very few buildings remain standing if any at all. Almost 100 percent of the homes on the island have been completely wiped out.\n  \"None of the roads are passable and moving to and from anywhere on the island has been very difficult.\"\n  Another area of particular concern was Guiuan, a fishing town of about 40,000 people on Samar that was the first to be hit after Haiyan swept in from the Pacific Ocean. The Red Cross's Pang said contact had not yet been made with \nGuiuan.\n  Pang also expressed concern for people in the province of Capiz, about 200km west of Tacloban, on Panay island where she said most of the region's infrastructure had been destroyed and many houses \"flattened to the ground\".\n  Meteorologists said the impact may not have been as strong as feared because the storm was moving so quickly, reducing the risk of flooding and landslides from torrential rain, the biggest causes of typhoon casualties in the Philippines.\n  Transports halted\n  Ferry services and airports in the central Philippines remained closed, hampering aid deliveries to Tacloban, although the military said two C-130 transport planes managed to land at its airport on Saturday.\n     \nAndrews said the airport terminal was destroyed by the typhoon, which also blew off the roof of the airport tower in Roxas City in Capiz province to the west.\n  At least two more people had been killed on the tourist destination of Cebu island, radio reports said.\n  Haiyan was the second Category 5 typhoon to hit the Philippines this year after Typhoon Usagi in September. An average of 20 typhoons strike every year, and Haiyan was the 24th in 2013. \nLast year, Typhoon Bopha flattened three towns in southern Mindanao, killing 1,100 people and causing damage of more than $1bn.\n                                                                                                \n                        Far-right ELAM party calls for an end to 'illegal migration' and hopes to gain support amid Cyprus' weak economy.
