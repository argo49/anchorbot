There are states all over the world that say you can't own firearms - and that's not true anymore. \n          \"I'm seeing a world where technology says you can pretty much be able to have whatever you want. It's not up to the political players any more.\"\n          Asked if he felt any sense of responsibility about whose hands the gun might fall into, he told the BBC: \"I recognise the tool might be used to harm other people - that's what the tool is - it's a gun. \n           \"But I don't think that's a reason to not do it - or a reason not to put it out there.\"\n    Gun control  \t      To make the gun, Mr Wilson received a manufacturing and seller's licence from the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF).\n          Donna Sellers, from the ATF, told BBC News that the 3D-printed gun, as long as it was not a National Firearms Act weapon (an automatic gun, for example), was legal in the US.\n          She said: \"[In the US] a person can manufacture a firearm for their own use. However, if they engage in the business of manufacture to sell a gun, they need a licence.\"\n          Amid America's ongoing gun debate in the wake of the shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, US congressman Steve Israel recently called for a ban on 3D guns under the Undetectable Firearms Act.\n          Groups looking to tighten US gun laws have also expressed concern. \n          Leah Gunn Barrett, from New Yorkers Against Gun Violence, has said: \"These guns could fall into the hands of people who should not have guns - criminals, people who are seriously mentally ill, people who are convicted of domestic violence, even children.\"\n          3D printing technology has already been used by some criminal organisations to create card readers - \"skimmers\" - that are inserted into bank machines.\n          Many law enforcement agencies around the world now have people dedicated to monitoring cybercrime and emerging technologies such as 3D printers.\n          Ms Baines from Europol said: \"What we know is that technology proceeds much more quickly than we expect it to. So by getting one step ahead of the technological developments, we hope and believe we will be able to get one step ahead of the criminals as well.\"
