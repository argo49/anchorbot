It's built from 33 mostly stainless-steel parts and has a carbon-fiber handgrip carved with a laser.\n \"The 3-D-printed metal gun proves that 3-D printing isn't just making trinkets and Yoda heads,\" the company said in the blog post.\n Solid Concepts went out of its way Friday to point out that producing the metal gun isn't meant to advance a trend that worries law enforcement and some politicians. As 3-D printers become more widespread and affordable, some envision a near future in which criminals can crank out untraceable weapons without having to leave their homes.\n \"Let me start out by saying one, very important thing: This is not about desktop 3-D printers,\" Alyssa Parkinson, a spokeswoman for the company, wrote in the blog post.\n The metal gun wasn't a move toward making firearms with a 3-D printer cheaper or more accessible, she wrote.\n Basic 3-D printers, such as the MakerBot Replicator 2, can be bought for around $2,000. But Solid Concepts used a specialized, high-end printer whose cost would be out of reach of most people.\n \"The industrial printer we used costs more than my college tuition (and I went to a private university),\" Parkinson said. \"And the engineers who run our machines are top of the line; they are experts who know what they're doing and understand 3-D printing better than anyone in this business.\"\n Solid Concepts wanted to show that 3-D printing is more than just hobbyists churning out plastic doodads -- it's a viable option for serious commercial use.\n \"It's a common misconception that 3-D printing isn't accurate or strong enough, and we're working to change people's perspectives,\" Kent Firestone, a vice president at the company, said in a statement.\n In May, a nonprofit group, also from Texas, stirred far more controversy when it posted a video of the live firing of a plastic handgun created with a 3-D printer.\n Cody Wilson, a 25-year-old self-described anarchist, posted instructions on how to make the gun online through his nonprofit group, Defense Distributed.\n Those instructions were taken down after the U.S. State Department sent the group a cease-and-desist letter. The group's website was shut down shortly afterward.\n Solid Concepts is a licensed firearm manufacturer. It said one use for its new capabilities with 3-D printers may be selling replacement parts for handguns.\n","entities":[{"type":"FieldTerminology","relevance":"0.844139","count":"4","text":"nonprofit group"},{"type":"Person","relevance":"0.672943","count":"2","text":"Alyssa Parkinson"},{"type":"Person","relevance":"0.653579","count":"2","text":"John Browning","disambiguated":{"subType":["Inventor"],"name":"John Browning","dbpedia":"http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/John_Browning","freebase":"http:\/\/rdf.freebase.com\/ns\/m.0132vd","yago":"http:\/\/yago-knowledge.org\/resource\/John_Browning"}},{"type":"StateOrCounty","relevance":"0.629532","count":"2","text":"Texas","disambiguated":{"subType":["Location","PoliticalDistrict","AdministrativeDivision","GovernmentalJurisdiction","USState"],"name":"Texas","geo":"31.0 -100.0","website":"http:\/\/www.texasonline.com\/","dbpedia":"http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Texas","freebase":"http:\/\/rdf.freebase.com\/ns\/m.07b_l","opencyc":"http:\/\/sw.opencyc.org\/concept\/Mx4rvVkBk5wpEbGdrcN5Y29ycA","yago":"http:\/\/yago-knowledge.org\/resource\/Texas"}},{"type":"Company","relevance":"0.556916","count":"1","text":"CNN","disambiguated":{"subType":["Broadcast","AwardWinner","RadioNetwork","TVNetwork"],"name":"CNN","website":"http:\/\/www.cnn.com\/","dbpedia":"http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/CNN","freebase":"http:\/\/rdf.freebase.com\/ns\/m.0gsgr","yago":"http:\/\/yago-knowledge.org\/resource\/CNN"}},{"type":"FieldTerminology","relevance":"0.452591","count":"1","text":"law enforcement"},{"type":"Person","relevance":"0.447691","count":"1","text":"Kent Firestone"},{"type":"Organization","relevance":"0.447212","count":"1","text":"U.S. State Department","disambiguated":{"subType":["GovernmentAgency","GovernmentalBody","AppointedRole"],"name":"United States Department of State","website":"http:\/\/www.state.gov","dbpedia":"http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/United_States_Department_of_State","freebase":"http:\/\/rdf.freebase.com\/ns\/m.07vsl","opencyc":"http:\/\/sw.opencyc.org\/concept\/Mx4rvXeGY5wpEbGdrcN5Y29ycA","yago":"http:\/\/yago-knowledge.org\/resource\/United_States_Department_of_State"}},{"type":"JobTitle","relevance":"0.440584","count":"1","text":"vice president"},{"type":"Person","relevance":"0.43616","count":"1","text":"Cody Wilson"},{"type":"FieldTerminology","relevance":"0.392605","count":"1","text":"shut down"}]}
