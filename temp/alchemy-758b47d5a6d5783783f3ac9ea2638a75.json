They are publicizing the case to see whether others may come forward, Jones said Friday.\n The man's position was not immediately known, but Jones said \"he worked with kids.\"\n A town hall meeting for families is scheduled for Thursday.\n Mary Doyle, also with public affairs at Fort Meade, told CNN that the center generally serves children in grades 6-8 through sports programs and non-athletic activities, such as computer labs and arts and crafts. On weekends, younger children occasionally partake in activities.\n About 20 staff members typically are at the center when activities under way, Doyle said. The Youth Center is not a school.\n Schools at Fort Meade are operated by Maryland's Anne Arundel County Public Schools. The employee in question had no connection to any of the schools, she said.\n A 24-hour family hotline has been set up for anyone who has more questions for base officials.\n The FBI said it would have no comment. Civilian law enforcement alerted Fort Meade to the alleged incident, officials said.\n George Wright with Army public affairs said the FBI is leading the investigation because the allegation involves a federal facility.\n \"Fort Meade is fully cooperating with the FBI's investigation and is providing support to families as necessary,\" he said in a statement.\n CNN's Larry Shaughnessy contributed to this report.\n","entities":[{"type":"Facility","relevance":"0.885955","count":"5","text":"Fort Meade","disambiguated":{"subType":["Location","MilitaryPost","Museum"],"name":"Fort George G.
