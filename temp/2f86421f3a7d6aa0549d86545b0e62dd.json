Investigative journalist Simon Ostrovsky reports on the aftermath of cyclone Nargis - we see the harrowing journey he makes into the disaster zone, and how people there are coping with the aid that's trickling through.  Shall we have a discussion? </unknownNode><unknownNode>What on earth are Europe's leaders going to do about the Irish NO on Lisbon. David Grossman and Neil Breakwell are in Brussels. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Do we need to open the debate on GM because of the global food crisis? That's what the Environment Minister, Phil Woolas, seems to be saying. Susan Watts is on the case. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Are there any lighter stories you think we should get on air? Please look around.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>Other big stories around: Hamas/Israel ceasefire watch.  Zimbabwe. Mugabe and Mbeki have held talks. Bodies of MDC supporters have been found. Rice discussing crisis at Security Council.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Anything else? See you in a minute.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Yours, Shaminder  </unknownNode><unknownNode>From tonight's presenter, Kirsty Wark:</unknownNode><unknownNode>Crunch time</unknownNode><unknownNode>It's Alistair Darling's BIG NIGHT OUT at the Mansion House - and boy, is there a lot for him to talk about.</unknownNode><unknownNode>With the prospect of energy prices rising by 40 per cent by Christmas according to an industry insider today, and so soon after his letter from the Governor of the Bank of England warning inflation might hit four per cent by Christmas, AND with public sector unions threatening strikes if the government does not renegotiate pay settlements - what exactly is he going to say?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Will he talk down growth, warn about pay restraint and shake a big stick at the City and its big fat bonuses? We'll be there.</unknownNode><unknownNode>We'll also hear from the Shadow Chancellor George Osborne and debate whether pay settlements really should or could be held down.  Do let us know how life is for you during the Crunch by commenting below.</unknownNode><unknownNode>French economy</unknownNode><unknownNode>We'll also have the economic view from across the channel. We have an interview with the French Finance Minister, Christine Lagarde on France's problems with the economy and the future of the EU now that the Irish have said "no" to the Lisbon Treaty.   Afghanistan</unknownNode><unknownNode>Our diplomatic Editor Mark Urban is following up on the deadliest attack on UK forces in Afghanistan since hostilities began seven years ago. Four soldiers - three men and a woman - were killed in an explosion east of Lashkar Gah in Helmand Province. Weren't we meant to be winning the war against the Taleban?</unknownNode><unknownNode>After Nargis</unknownNode><unknownNode>And we have an extraordinary, exclusive film of unseen Burma - of two doctors working for the NGO Merlin in an area devastated by the cyclone, where they were operating with the permission of the Burmese authorities.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Click here to read more.</unknownNode><unknownNode>From today's output editor Simon Enright - here's his morning e-mail to the production team:</unknownNode><unknownNode>Good Morning,</unknownNode><unknownNode>Lots of stories which should we take on to uncover something a little deeper.</unknownNode><unknownNode>-	The biggest loss of British life in Afghanistan for 2 years. Weren't we winning the war against the Taleban?  -	First Mansion House Speech for Mr Darling... Will he keep the economy on track and can he restrain pay? -	Abu Qatada released but under severe bail conditions. Will we learn more about where he is today? -	Plans for tackling our attitudes to crime. Will the government accept any of them? So you know.... We have two things planned. Christine Lagarde, the French finance minister will be talking to us - what should we ask about? </unknownNode><unknownNode>We also have a film produced by Mark Lobel of unseen Burma. The footage is from two doctors working for Merlin, but they were operating with the permission of the Burma regime.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Do come with thoughts at 10.30.</unknownNode><unknownNode>All the best, Simon</unknownNode><unknownNode>INFLATION  The rate of inflation has hit its highest level for 11 years and the governor of the Bank of England says it could keep on rising.  The Consumer Prices Index hit 3.3% last month, up from 3% in April.  The bank governor Mervyn King has written to the government saying that rising food and oil prices could push inflation over 4% this year. We'll be asking how bad could this get and what are the solutions? Treasury Minister, Yvette Cooper will join us in studio. The Newsnight Shadow Monetary Policy Committee will reconvene to tell us what could happen next. Are we heading for further increases in inflation, interest rate rises and recession?</unknownNode><unknownNode> CAROLINE SPELMAN The Conservative Party Chairman Caroline Spelman is to face a Commons inquiry into the use of her MPs' expenses to pay for a nanny. The Parliamentary Standards Commissioner has ordered an investigation after Newsnight's Michael Crick reported that she'd used her secretarial allowance to pay a nanny more than a decade ago. Caroline Spelman insists she's done nothing wrong.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Watch the reports here.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Meanwhile, Cabinet Minister, Hazel Blears, may have broken the rules on the handling of restricted government information. A personal computer that holds restricted government documents relating to defence and extremism was stolen from her constituency office in Salford on Saturday. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Political Editor, Michael Crick will join us live. </unknownNode><unknownNode> ZIMBABWE A United Nations envoy met Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe today to discuss the violent political crisis ahead of this month's presidential election run-off. The visit is the first by a senior UN official for three years and comes at a time of growing international pressure on Mugabe over the June 27 vote. Opposition leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, President Mugabe's Western critics and human right groups accuse the veteran leader of orchestrating a violent campaign to intimidate MDC supporters and leaders ahead of the election. Because the BBC isn't allowed into Zimbabwe Ian Pannell has gone in undercover. His report includes new allegations of intimidation by the President's party against the opposition.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>US ELECTIONS  We'll be speaking to America's most successful political blogger, Arianna Huffington about the power of the web in the election campaign.   </unknownNode><unknownNode>Hello. This is the Baghdad Blogger. It's been a while since the last blog online and on television so I'll try and not be too sad if you've forgotten about me and moved on to more interesting blogs and bloggers. </unknownNode><unknownNode>About a year ago my family decided to leave Iraq. I was coming to the UK for a year to study and most of my extended family had already left Iraq as the levels of violence on the streets rose and we all felt frustrated by the lack of any improvement.    It wasn't an easy decision to make. We as a family stayed in Iraq and witnessed the death of friends and relatives; sat at home through days of waiting for good news from kidnapped acquaintances and clung to every little change on the political landscape in hope that this will be the moment things will change to the better. </unknownNode><unknownNode>We left our home as my neighbourhood somehow became a Sunni enclave and became less safe for my mother. And helped my aunts and uncles do the same.    There was a moment when most of the things I loved about Baghdad became a memory as I sat in our new home. </unknownNode><unknownNode>My father's brief involvement in politics meant that we had to live within a protected area and his fear for us meant that if we were to go out on the street we would have to be escorted. </unknownNode><unknownNode>I put my camera aside, my mother stopped visiting her siblings or going to the shops.   One morning we were woken up by one of the guards assigned to protect my father and told that American soldiers are at the door, they want to search our house. </unknownNode><unknownNode>They suspect we were hiding explosives. As we stood outside while the house was searched we were told that the neighbours had told the nearby American check point that they should check us out.   It was a Shia area, my father's Sunni tribe made them suspicious. The American soldiers left after finding nothing. And for us it was clearly time to move out.    This is when we, like almost two million Iraqis, decided it was safer for to leave for a while. Most of us who have left Iraq looked for refuge in neighbouring countries. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Like my own family most Iraqis are in Jordan, Syria, Lebanon or the United Arab Emirates - my own is spread throughout three of those four, as not all of us were able to get some sort of legal residence in the same country. And a much smaller percentage made it to shores farther away including the UK.   In the next couple of days I will be trying to find out more about the situation of Iraqi asylum seekers in the UK and will be making a film about their situation here to be shown on Newsnight in July.   I will be finding out what is happening to Iraqis whose application for refugee status here has been refused and also talking to Caroline Slocock from Refugee Legal Centre about what appears to be the Home Office's decision to accelerate forced deportations of failed asylum seekers.</unknownNode><unknownNode>I will keep you posted.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Salam's report will be broadcast on Newsnight in late June.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Today's output editor is Robert Morgan - here's his morning e-mail to the production team:</unknownNode><unknownNode>Hello everyone,</unknownNode><unknownNode>The big squeeze continues. The soaring cost of fuel and food has pushed inflation above 3% for the first time since March last year. The cost of living is now running at 3.3%. It means that the governor of the Bank of England, Mervyn King, will now have to write a letter to the Chancellor to explain why the figure has risen more than 1% above the government's target, of 2%. Let's discuss how we should do this story in the meeting.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Bids are in for the Chancellor and Yvette Cooper.</unknownNode><unknownNode>A top UN official is due in Zimbabwe for a five-day visit ahead of the presidential run-off, which continues to be marred by political violence.  Haile Menkerios is expected to meet politicians to discuss the situation in the run-up to the 27 June vote.  Violence is reported to have spread to urban areas near Harare, with opposition activists complaining of being attacked near the city. The UK Prime Minister called Zimbabwe's government a "criminal regime".  Despite a ban on the BBC operating in Zimbabwe, Ian Pannell reports on the election campaign from inside the country. The film will need astons, archive, graphics to be dropped in later. Will send later today. We have an interview with America's top political blogger Arianna Huffington about the US elections and her impact on them.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Other stories around today include the EU Treaty in the Lords, the Shell Strike and the latest extraordinary brain research. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Robert </unknownNode><unknownNode>BRITISH TROOPS Are we paying too high a price for our commitments in Afghanistan? The Defence Secretary Des Browne announced today that troop numbers in Afghanistan will increase to a new high of more than 8,000 by next spring, but is British policy working in the south of the country? Coalition deaths in Afghanistan last month exceeded those in Iraq for the first time. We have the Defence Secretary, Des Browne, and Lord Paddy Ashdown on the programme.</unknownNode><unknownNode>MP's NANNY  Michael Crick has been investigating new allegations about the Conservative Chair Caroline Spelman. Last weekend she defended using parliamentary allowances ten years ago to pay her nanny by saying that the nanny had also been working as her constituency secretary.</unknownNode><unknownNode>ANNAN INTERVIEW We interview former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan on a new call for aid for Africa - but should leaders on the continent do more to solve their own problems?  </unknownNode><unknownNode>SOUTH AFRICA And a special report from Orla Guerin about the wave of xenophobic violence that has swept South Africa, leading to horrific attacks on refugees which were broadcast around the world. But what turned defenceless foreigners into targets, and where does the blame lie?</unknownNode><unknownNode>See Jeremy Paxman tonight at 22.30 on BBC 2 </unknownNode><unknownNode>A little noticed fact from last week's Conservative mini-reshuffle is that all three of David Cameron's most important front bench colleagues - George Osborne (Treasury), William Hague (Foreign Affairs) and now Dominic Grieve (Home Affairs) - went to Magdalen College, Oxford.  I wonder if this has ever happened before in the history of British politics? </unknownNode><unknownNode>This quirk is a little unfortunate perhaps for a party trying to stress its new inclusivity under David Cameron.  But then Labour failed dismally in its efforts to exploit the toff factor in the London mayoral race and in the Crewe and Nantwich by-election.</unknownNode><unknownNode>In my time at Oxford, in the late 1970s, Magdalen was the faction in the University Conservative Association (OUCA) which included most of the more right-wing Thatcherite members, and they ran a powerful machine in student politics.  Left-wing Tories such as the Conservative's current immigration spokesman, Damian Green, were associated with Balliol.</unknownNode><unknownNode>A number of weekend papers have reported on the famous incident in the autumn of 1977 when a bunch of Magdalen men, somewhat the worse for drink, dumped Damian Green into the Cherwell River after he had visited the college one evening for dinner.   And this gang of Magdalen hearties included Dominic Grieve, who has just taken over as Green's boss in the Conservative Home Affairs team.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>I was editor of the Oxford University newspaper (also called Cherwell) at the time and recall running the story as a front-page splash (as it were).  I'll try and obtain a copy of the article for the blog as soon as I can.</unknownNode><unknownNode> </unknownNode><unknownNode>Good morning.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Looks busy today.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Bush and Brown meet today and will have a press conference this morning (10.30). As well as apparent differences on Iraq, there is an Afghanistan statement later today. Who should we have on?</unknownNode><unknownNode>We have an interview with Kofi Annan as a new Africa report is published. The Africa panel are asking for the pledges made at Gleneagles Summit in 2005 to be met. Western governments are to be asked for billions more in funding. But why though should the West continue to give so much aid to African Governments when they seem so disinclined to resolve Zimbabwe, Darfur and other conflicts. Is the teacher/pupil model implied by the African panel healthy or effective?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Crick has more on the Caroline Spellman story, I'll explain in the meeting.</unknownNode><unknownNode>What else would you like to do? Which guests would you like on? </unknownNode><unknownNode>Dan  </unknownNode><unknownNode>Good morning.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Looks busy today.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Bush and Brown meet today and will have a press conference this morning (10.30).

Which guests would you like on? </unknownNode><unknownNode>Dan  </unknownNode><unknownNode>So the big question is - will Labour stand in by-election? </unknownNode><unknownNode>I spent much of the morning trying to track down their parliamentary candidate Dan Marten, who is still apparently in his early 20s and a student at Hull University. </unknownNode><unknownNode>When I finally got through to him on the phone my first question was - "Do you support the government on 42 days?"</unknownNode><unknownNode>"No comment," he replied. "You'll have to speak to the Labour Party press office."</unknownNode><unknownNode>"But surely you can tell us whether you support 42 days?"</unknownNode><unknownNode>"No comment." </unknownNode><unknownNode>And so it went.. "No comment, no comment, no comment." </unknownNode><unknownNode>"And do you think Labour should fight the by-election?"</unknownNode><unknownNode>"No comment."</unknownNode><unknownNode>There was a time when parliamentary candidates used to hold opinions and weren't frightened of expressing them. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Europe's Friday 13th If Ireland's reaction to the new proposed European Union constitutional treaty were to be a hand signal it would probably involve the extension of the middle finger of the right hand in the air. Ireland says NO. This throws the carefully oiled process by which all the other governments across the continent skilfully have NOT asked their voters' opinions into disarray. We'll be debating what the European Union does next - and perhaps more importantly, why democracy and the EU do not really seem to go together.   David Davis As if David Davis has not suffered enough - we've sent Michael Crick to his constituency. I have no idea what he's found out, but as always it will be worth watching. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Clearly the good people of Howden have the right idea about something. While filming there today I noticed their local library had a copy of an important book about one of Mr Davis's former rivals.</unknownNode><unknownNode>We're planning to review The Incredible Hulk. Ang Lee's art-house version of the Hulk story in 2003 was not a hit with the fans. Will this one be? It'll be interesting to get our panellist (and comic book fan) Natalie Haynes' view.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Coldplay's latest album is out. Our panellist, the music critic John Harris, is a "Coldplay Cynic". Will he be won over by this more experimental album? And have you been?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Michael Frayn once again draws inspiration from 20th Century history in his latest play, Afterlife which opened at the National Theatre this week. He links the turbulent tale of the life of German theatre impresario Max Reinhart with the narrative of the play he famously directed - Everyman. And he makes the bold decision to write half the play in verse. What will the historian on the panel, Tristram Hunt, make of it?</unknownNode><unknownNode>And Bob Dylan is another musical legend who has turned his hand to visual art. An exhibition of his paintings has opened in London? What will our panel make of it? </unknownNode><unknownNode>Do leave your own reviews below - or suggest other things you'd like us to look at in the weeks to come.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>Former editor of the Sun newspaper Kelvin Mackenzie has indicated that he's 90% certain to stand as a pro 42 days candidate in the Haltemprice and Howden by-election; caused by the resignation of David Davis. </unknownNode><unknownNode>And on the BBC's This Week programme he revealed that his old boss Rupert Murdoch had offered to back his campaign financially:</unknownNode><unknownNode>"Rupert suggested to me that if Labour didn't put anyone up, that I would run against David Davis, if that's the case - and Rupert says he's good for the money... I might well do it," Mr Mackenzie said.</unknownNode><unknownNode>But there is one problem with that.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Mr Murdoch is an American citizen and so under British law is not allowed to contribute funds to any UK election campaign.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Perhaps Mr Murdoch will try to channel his funds through his business - NewsCorp - but that would also be illegal since NewsCorp is also American     I suppose Murdoch and Mackenzie could try and fund the campaign through one of Murdoch's British subsidiary companies. But that surely would make a mockery of our laws for foreign funding of British elections.</unknownNode><unknownNode> </unknownNode><unknownNode>Today's output editor is Richard Pattinson - here's his e-mail to the production team...</unknownNode><unknownNode>Morning everyone and happy Friday 13th.    We'll have the results of the Irish referendum at around teatime, although may well get a strong indicator earlier. A leading bookie is already paying out for Yes bets but with initial reports of a low turnout that could be very premature. If it's a No, what would that mean for the EU? Who do you want to hear from?   Michael and Stuart are heading up to Haltemprice and Howden following yesterday's extraordinary announcement. Will David Davis be out pressing the flesh today? And will Kelvin MacKenzie really stand against him?    Other stories  Oil. The partial strike is under way - will there be significant panic buying? Plus a meeting in Brussels today over high UK fuel duty rates and fresh oil data out from OPEC.   Oh and it's the 100th anniversary of the tea bag apparently. Why today exactly I can't work out.   Anything else take your fancy?    Richard  </unknownNode><unknownNode>Is the resignation by the Shadow Home Secretary a sign of principle in politics or a temper tantrum at the top of the Conservative party? </unknownNode><unknownNode>We'll have the latest on the Davis bombshell after an extraordinary day at Westminster. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Plus we'll also be reporting from Ireland on the knife-edge European referendum and from Australia on the man who was seen as the Gordon Brown of Down Under. </unknownNode><unknownNode>So why has Prime Minister Kevin Rudd done so well?  </unknownNode><unknownNode>Good morning. Today's output editor is Dan Kelly - here's his e-mail to the production team...</unknownNode><unknownNode>Good morning all.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Some good stories today - what are your thoughts?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Today sees the culmination of the BMA's campaign against the government's plans for so-called "super-surgeries" in England. They claim that plans for polyclinics and GP-led health centres  - which will group more GPs together and offer extra services - will lead to the end of the traditional local GP surgery and many closures. They've managed to spook their patients too - 1.2 m have signed a petition opposing the plans. Are doctors just protecting their own interests? Ministers say the BMA campaign is "mendacious" and "misleading".</unknownNode><unknownNode>What more can we do on the secret documents story?</unknownNode><unknownNode>The Irish referendum on the Lisbon treaty takes place today. How has the No campaign - a rainbow coalition of nationalists, free marketers and left wingers - managed to bring Europe to the brink? David Grossman is on the story in Dublin.</unknownNode><unknownNode>We have a piece from Australia on PM Rudd - why has he succeeded where Brown has not? </unknownNode><unknownNode>Annie Lennox is being awarded with a Red Cross honour today for her charity work on Aids, but can Celebs ever do any lasting good in this field or is vanity the real winner? We have an interview.   </unknownNode><unknownNode>Other ideas? Guest suggestions?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Dan</unknownNode><unknownNode>In tonight's programme - two knife-edge votes - one in Westminster on 42-day detention and one in Ireland on the new European constitutional treaty. </unknownNode><unknownNode>We'll be assessing how far tonight's vote may help Gordon Brown to bounce back - and how far tomorrow's vote in Ireland could sink the "European project".</unknownNode><unknownNode>Plus a report from Afghanistan on whether the billions of dollars of aid that have poured into the country have been spent effectively.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>The two opening speeches in this afternoon's debate on 42 days were not a great Parliamentary occasion which will stick in the memory.  Both Jacqui Smith and David Davis were beset by and allowed far too many interventions from backbenchers.  Despite the many personal phone calls from Gordon Brown to Labour backbenchers, and the many reported "bribes" to those who are thought to be wavering, it looks like the vote could be close.</unknownNode><unknownNode>It may all boil down to the Democratic Unionists, now led by Peter Robinson.  Several DUP MPs sat listening to the opening speeches, and at one point I saw them gathered in a huddle at the entrance to the chamber.</unknownNode><unknownNode>One perhaps significant intervention came from the DUP's former mayor for Belfast Sammy Wilson, who suggested that the government's 42-day measure, the Parliamentary and public debate that would surround its use, would provide terrorists with, in Margaret Thatcher's old phrase, the "oxygen of publicity".  Not what Jacqui Smith would have wanted to hear if she's hoping for the DUP's nine votes. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Today's output editor is Shaminder Nahal - here's her morning e-mail to the production team:</unknownNode><unknownNode>Hello everyone.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Today, MPs vote on 42-day detention for terrorist suspects.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Tomorrow, the Irish people vote in a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty. David Grossman and Sarah Teasdale are in Dublin.</unknownNode><unknownNode>We have a film from Alastair Leithead and Richard Colebourn on how effectively billions of dollars of aid have been spent in Afghanistan.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>What else?</unknownNode><unknownNode>See you in a minute, Shaminder</unknownNode><unknownNode>42 days From 28 days to 42.  What are the chances of success for Gordon Brown with the serried ranks of Conservatives, Liberal Democrats and some Labour backbenchers implacably opposed to this key part of the Government's Counter-Terrorism Bill?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Tomorrow's debate could be a defining moment for Gordon Brown's premiership, but far from bringing more MPs onside, opposition may be hardening with key players bolstering the case against - the DPP Sir Ken MacDonald, the Lord Advocate in Scotland Eilish Angiolini, the former Justice Secretary Lord Falconer, and the former Prime Minister John Major. </unknownNode><unknownNode>On the other side - the Met Police Commissioner Sir Ian Blair, the independent reviewer of terror laws Lord Carlile, the Chair of the British Muslim Forum, Khurshid Ahmed and the former head of MI6, Sir Richard Dearlove.  Tonight we will be doing the parliamentary arithmetic and asking whether Gordon Brown has made an effective case for 42 day detention, and if he fails is it a matter of confidence? </unknownNode><unknownNode>NHS  Why is it that the NHS in England and Wales insists that if you pay for any part of your treatment privately then you are barred from NHS care for that condition from that point on? The papers have revealed countless cases recently of people who've topped up the care and landed themselves with a bill. We know that Lord Darzi is producing a report for the government on future care but will he deal with this issue? Paul Mason is investigating and we'll debate the issue with leading proponents from both sides. Join our NHS debate here.   Uganda Kirsty is also just interviewing President Museveni of Uganda - one of Africa's most senior leaders. He recently visited Zimbabwe and with opposition leaders there worried that elections will be neither free nor fair. She'll be questioning this friend of Mugabe about what next for the country.</unknownNode><unknownNode>The Pump Finally here at Newsnight we've adopted a petrol station. With growing concern about the price of goods we wanted to hear views from the pump. If you too are feeling the credit crunch - and with news today that many home-owners are facing negative equity there must many of you - then please put your comments at the pump below.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>Today's output editor is Simon Enright - here's his morning e-mail to the production team:</unknownNode><unknownNode>Hello All,</unknownNode><unknownNode>So what should we lead on today? Tomorrow sees the crucial 42 day parliamentary vote and David Miliband has cut short his trip to fly back today to help lead the debate.</unknownNode><unknownNode>We have an interview with President Museveni of Uganda. We can ask about so many different issues... Ethiopia's famine, Zimbabwe, continental leadership, South Africa? What should we ask him about?</unknownNode><unknownNode>The Conservative MP for Billericay, John Baron, has called a debate on NHS co-payment in the Commons today. If you top up your NHS care with private help then you get clobbered with the whole bill for your NHS treatment. Does any party have a policy which addresses this - we are all waiting for Lord Darzi's report which is due out soon.</unknownNode><unknownNode>What about poverty - is there more on that we should do today after the Archbishop yesterday? The official figures out this morning. If the Gordon Brown government isn't tackling this then what are they for?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Finally we have the second of our films about how the credit crunch is biting - at the Petrol pump. Jackie Long with Hugh Milbourn producing. Should we do more on the economy?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Or should we just ask Susan Watts to explain to us why the dolphins are dying Cornwall.</unknownNode><unknownNode>There is space for more ideas so do come armed to the 10.30 meeting.</unknownNode><unknownNode>All the best</unknownNode><unknownNode>Simon</unknownNode><unknownNode>From tonight's presenter, Emily Maitlis:</unknownNode><unknownNode>Is anyone listening? I have just interviewed the Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams about the state of British children and how we treat them. He told me - in the context of a report by Children's Commissioners, out today - that we as a society often act in a punitive frame of mind, and behave as if we don't really like children. He said he had yet to see evidence that custodial sentences for young people actually worked. </unknownNode><unknownNode>But he also revealed something rather interesting. When I asked him if he would offer stronger leadership on the difference between right and wrong and the way we lead our lives he replied: '"Do you think that people in this country faced with 'muscular Christianity' as you call it are going to change their ways because I say so or anyone else says so?" So tonight we ask what it means when the very head of the Anglican Church concedes that little he says really makes a difference.    </unknownNode><unknownNode>Expenses Since our investigation into the expenses of the Tory party chair on Friday, Ms Spelman has been resolutely defending her position. Today she met the Parliamentary Standards Commissioner following complaints that she used taxpayers' money to pay for a nanny. The man who broke the story - one Michael Crick - joins us live. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Farc Venezuela's President Chavez has told Columbia's foremost terrorist group to lay down their arms and free all their hostages. Why now? Frank Gardner, fresh back from Columbia where he's been looking at the hostage taking situation there, will be in the studio. </unknownNode><unknownNode>AIDS The international community has poured millions of dollars into prevention of HIV/AIDS in the former Soviet Union. But despite this money, the virus is on a dramatic rise and especially in Central Asia. Drugs and prostitution are the most common reasons behind the spread of the virus, although the most recent mass outbreaks happened inside hospitals and the victims are children. Natalia Antalava looks at what role hospitals play in the spread of the infection and why the healthcare system is emerging as one of the reasons as to why Central Asia is losing its battle against HIV/AIDS.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Bobby Kennedy And we revisit the circumstances surrounding RFK's death. As promised, indeed, on Friday. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Today's output editor is Robert Morgan - here's his morning e-mail to the production team:</unknownNode><unknownNode>Good morning everyone,</unknownNode><unknownNode>We've got an interview with the Archbishop of Canterbury on the Children's Commissioners report on childhood. Are too many of our children being locked up and left in poverty? </unknownNode><unknownNode>Caroline Spelman, oil prices and Columbia look interesting too. Do come to the meeting with ideas on how to do these stories and others.</unknownNode><unknownNode>We've got a film from Natalia Antalava and Sara: </unknownNode><unknownNode>The international community has poured millions of dollars into prevention of HIV/AIDS in the former Soviet Union.

What total sum did Caroline Spelman pay Tina Haynes (nee Rawlins) from her Parliamentary Staffing Allowance in the period 1997-98?</unknownNode><unknownNode>2.  What were the exact dates of Tina Haynes's employment as constituency secretary, and the dates for which she was paid from Spelman's Parliamentary Staffing Allowance?</unknownNode><unknownNode>3.  Was there a contract of employment, as a constituency secretary, or for her secretarial work?</unknownNode><unknownNode>4.  What did this specify?</unknownNode><unknownNode>5.  Was there a contract of employment for her childcare work, and what did this specify?</unknownNode><unknownNode>6.  What paperwork, apart from letters to claim Tina Haynes's pay from Parliament, is there to prove Tina Haynes was really acting as Caroline Spelman's constituency secretary for that period?</unknownNode><unknownNode>7.  Was Tina Haynes qualified in any way as a secretary? Did she have any typing/shorthand/filing/computer skills etc.</unknownNode><unknownNode>8.  Was Tina Haynes a trained nursery nurse?</unknownNode><unknownNode>10.  Had Tina Haynes ever worked as a secretary before working for Caroline Spelman, and has she ever worked as a secretary since then?</unknownNode><unknownNode>11.  Has Caroline Spelman ever provided an employment reference for Tina Haynes, and did this highlight her secretarial work? Can we see a copy?</unknownNode><unknownNode>12.  How many letters a week did Tina Haynes type for Caroline Spelman?</unknownNode><unknownNode>13. How many MPs' diary arrangements did Tina Haynes arrange for Caroline Spelman?</unknownNode><unknownNode>14.  How many phone calls of a parliamentary/political/constituency nature did Tina Haynes make on behalf of Caroline Spelman?</unknownNode><unknownNode>15.  Is it true that Tina Haynes was not paid any money for her childcare work from 1997-98? (The Conservative Party says she did the childcare for no pay but received free accommodation, use of a car and meals.)</unknownNode><unknownNode>16.  Did Tina Haynes carry on her childcare duties for no pay after her secretarial work ceased in 1998?</unknownNode><unknownNode>17.  Was Tina Haynes paid very much the same amount for her childcare work after 1998 as she was paid from the Parliamentary Allowance for her secretarial work before 1998?</unknownNode><unknownNode>18.  Did Tina Haynes know that her financial payments from Caroline Spelman from 1997 to 1998 were solely for secretarial work and not for her childcare work?</unknownNode><unknownNode>19.  Was the initial contact with Tina Haynes on the basis that she would be employed as a nanny, or as a secretary?</unknownNode><unknownNode>20.  What the position publicly advertised? If so, where? Did Caroline Spelman find Tina Haynes through a childcare agency or a secretarial agency?</unknownNode><unknownNode>21.  How was Tina Haynes paid for her childcare work from 1998 to 2002, and how much?</unknownNode><unknownNode>22.  What extra childcare duties, if any, did Tina Haynes perform after 1998?</unknownNode><unknownNode>23.  Did Tina Haynes continue to receive payment in kind after 1998 - ie free accommodation, use of a car and meals?</unknownNode><unknownNode>24.  If Tina Haynes was also paid wages after 1998, what extra childcare work was she doing to justify this new remuneration?</unknownNode><unknownNode>25.  Given that Caroline Spelman's youngest child was only two and half in May 1997, can Mrs Spelman confirm that all her three children were at school (or nursery or play-group) full time between 9am and 3pm, Monday to Friday, from May 1997 onwards?</unknownNode><unknownNode>26.  Has Caroline Spelman ever told the Commons authorities that Tina Haynes also worked as her nanny in 1997-98? When did she tell them this?</unknownNode><unknownNode>27.  What was Caroline Spelman's new constituency secretary, appointed in 1998, paid?  How does that pay compare with Tina Haynes? What extra duties did the new secretary fulfil, and how many hours a week did she work?</unknownNode><unknownNode>28.  Was Tina Haynes's name published anywhere as being her constituency secretary (though she was then called Tina Rawlins)?</unknownNode><unknownNode>29.  When did Caroline Spelman have her conversation with the Chief Whip, James Arbuthnot about this issue? Has any record been kept of that conversation? Did Caroline Spelman explain to Tina Haynes why she would no longer be acting as her constituency secretary?</unknownNode><unknownNode>30.  Did Tina Haynes look after Caroline Spelman's three children from 9am to 3pm during school half-terms and holidays?</unknownNode><unknownNode>31.  How many hours per week in total did Caroline Spelman expect Tina Haynes to work for her during the period 1997-98?</unknownNode><unknownNode>32.  Were Caroline Spelman's arrangements with Tina Haynes ever brought to the attention of William Hague, the then Conservative leader?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Eco Towns: Tomorrow night the village of Ford, in Sussex will hold a protest meeting to fight the imposition of an eco town on its doorstep. The government is planning ten such developments around the country, which they believe offer a sustainable strategy to solve a lack of housing. It's not just the celebrity dads who are up in arms - although the presence of Tim Henman's father has pushed the cause into new leagues of visibility. The award winning architect Richard Rogers says they would be 'one of the biggest mistakes the government could make'. And even the Green Brigade say that, of course, the truly eco solution is not to build them at all.  We'll be talking to the Housing Minister Caroline Flint. Is this all Nimbyism? And is anything actually wrong with Nimbyism if it is? </unknownNode><unknownNode>Race and Gender: The New Hampshire heckler who confronted Hillary Clinton with the banner saying 'iron my shirt' raised early questions about how much misogyny she would encounter on the campaign trail. It is hard to imagine how a hypothetical Obama heckler with a sign saying 'polish my shoes' would have been let off so lightly by either the media or indeed the law. Was the Democratic nomination lost to Hillary because of sexism? Probably not. Is race now less of an issue in America than gender? Again, probably not. But tonight, we hammer out the issue that has been ever present on this extraordinary and unprecedented campaign with feminist novelist and Clinton supporter - Erica Jong, and Jamal Simmons, Democrat strategist, Obama campaigner and yes, black man.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>Assassination Plots: It may seem a rather inopportune moment to re-examine the circumstances surrounding the death of a man who'd just won the Democratic presidential primary. But bear with us. Bobby Kennedy was shot dead in 1968, at the Ambassador Hotel, Los Angeles. That moment has been revisited and reinterpreted ad nauseam. Two years ago, the documentary film-maker Shane O'Sullivan made the case on Newsnight that CIA agents were present at the shooting. It turns out the story is rather different......</unknownNode><unknownNode>Join us for that, and more, at 10.30 on BBC 2</unknownNode><unknownNode>Emily </unknownNode><unknownNode> </unknownNode><unknownNode>On Review tonight:</unknownNode><unknownNode>We'll take a look at the BBC Four drama about Margaret Thatcher's attempts to be adopted as a Tory candidate: The Long Walk to Finchley. It'll be interesting to see what our panellist - the MP Michael Gove - makes of the way the young Maggie's relationship with the young Ted Heath has been depicted - there's something of a "frisson" there, to say the least. Carol Thatcher is reported to have objected to that aspect of the drama. </unknownNode><unknownNode>'Gone Baby Gone' is Ben Affleck's directorial debut about the disappearance of a four-year-old girl - its UK release was delayed because of the Madeleine McCann case. There's certainly an eerie similarity between her and the young actress. But will our panel think it was overly sensitive to delay it?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Novelist Nick Harkaway secured a &pound;300,000 deal for his first novel - 'The Gone Away World'. He's the son of John Le Carre - but don't expect a cold-war espionage thriller - this is altogether different. It'll be interesting to see if the panel thinks it lives up to the hype.</unknownNode><unknownNode>And - in her own words - "She's not the Dalai Lama...she's just a 'backwoods Barbie' in a push-up bra and heels". Really? It'll be fascinating to get Germaine Greer's take on Dolly Parton's latest album.</unknownNode><unknownNode>What issues should we raise with our guests?

Here's her morning e-mail to the production team:</unknownNode><unknownNode>Hello everyone,</unknownNode><unknownNode>Is there anything that particularly interests you today? Zimbabwe? Free swimming. (Can you really call that an Olympic legacy?)</unknownNode><unknownNode>Paul Mason is looking at eco-towns. The government wants 10 of them by 2020. But is it all just eco spin? Tomorrow a protest is being held at one of the proposed sites. Is it the start of a summer of discontent in Middle England?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Or is it a summer of strikes over public sector pay? Let's see what Unison says at lunch-time about the government's pay deal.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have held a private meeting ahead of her concession speech tomorrow. The bitter fight for the Democratic nomination opened up deep fault lines on race and gender.

Scott McClellan was George W Bush's White House Press Secretary for three crucial years during which he says in his new memoirs that President Bush "veered terribly off course" and was not open and forthright on Iraq. Given that he admits that some of his own assertions from the White House briefing room turned out to be "badly misguided". I'll be asking him&nbsp;live about what share of the blame he takes for his bosses actions.&nbsp; &nbsp; We'll also be hearing from our reporter alongside the Obama camp in Virginia - the latest on possible running mates, tactics and the Hillary issue.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Cheapest car  And&nbsp;exclusively revealed on Newsnight tonight, the world's cheapest car&nbsp;- the Tata Nano. We have the first look inside the factory which is making the &pound;1,000 car which could revolutionise car culture in India and bring a new set of questions on climate change.</unknownNode><unknownNode>NHS  And we want Newsnight viewers to participate in the launch of our UK map to create a picture of the health of the NHS at 60. &nbsp; Kirsty</unknownNode><unknownNode>On 5 July 1948 the National Health Service was brought into existence, making free public health care at the point of delivery available to all, funded by the tax system.</unknownNode><unknownNode>The NHS that is now 60-years-old is a very different beast.

I'm keen to look today at the new planning laws that will be debated in parliament on Monday. Politicians giving up powers to a new commission - is that the right way? David Grossman has planned this and John Healey the minister will do an interview.</unknownNode><unknownNode>But there is also lots of other news. Richard Dannatt  wants more pay for privates in the army. Gordon Brown wants more kids with knives in court.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>We have the first look inside the factory that is making the world's cheapest car - the Tata Nano. It could revolutionise sales of cars in India - and that has climate change implications.</unknownNode><unknownNode>We've also two other short films planned: The launch of our UK map to find a picture of health with the NHS at 60. And on the eve of the 40th anniversary of the assassination of RFK we look again at the theory that CIA agents were present in the hotel the night he died.</unknownNode><unknownNode>What else should we, can we do? How else should we deal with the planning story? Should we have guests?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Simon </unknownNode><unknownNode>I see that the Conservative candidate in the Henley by-election, John Howell, is describing himself on his early campaign literature as "Previously a presenter for BBC World Service". </unknownNode><unknownNode>My BBC World colleagues here at Millbank had never heard of him, but they made a few enquiries and it turns out that Mr Howell was a business presenter on BBC World around 1994 and 1995.   </unknownNode><unknownNode>The most remarkable feature of his presenting work, apparently, was that he used to wear a bow-tie. Click here to see him on BBC Breakfast News.</unknownNode><unknownNode>It looks like the Tory campaign will be something of an ex-BBC operation. Apart from John Howell the Conservative campaign is being run by senior Shadow Cabinet member Chris Grayling, who spent many years working in BBC news.</unknownNode><unknownNode>------------------------------------------------------</unknownNode><unknownNode>I'm sorry if anyone - including the candidate - found my comments unfair, one of the hazards of blogging. I've removed the offending passage.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Personally I have no idea if John Howell was a good presenter or not perhaps the best thing to do is to delve into the BBC archives and find a clip of him of at work - click here.</unknownNode><unknownNode>American Elections We are going to devote a significant proportion of tonight's programme to the most important major political event in the world this year - the contest between Senator Barack Obama and Senator John McCain. What difference will it make to America and the world if it is McCain rather than Obama?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Polish Plus, a Conservative MP with a Polish background has accused the BBC of  fuelling racist attacks on Polish immigrants. He says that it's also using Polish immigration as a soft and politically correct way of talking about the overall question of immigration from countries which - unlike Poland - are not predominantly white or Christian. </unknownNode><unknownNode> Does he have a point?  We'll be debating this live. </unknownNode><unknownNode>We also hope to be hearing from celebrated artist, David Hockney on art and indecency. </unknownNode><unknownNode> </unknownNode><unknownNode>The BBC is to blame for an increase in attacks on Poles, according to a Conservative MP.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Daniel Kawczynski told BBC Radio 4's Today programme this morning: "The liberal elite of the BBC are using the Poles as a cat's paw in a politically correct world to talk about immigration because you won't do stories about more controversial immigrants. You always focus on Poles.</unknownNode><unknownNode>"And as a result of that, Mr Humphrys, there are increased attacks on Poles in this country." </unknownNode><unknownNode>Listen to the interview here.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Is the BBC really to blame? Leave your comments below. </unknownNode><unknownNode>From today's output editor, Robert Morgan:</unknownNode><unknownNode>Good morning everyone,</unknownNode><unknownNode>The US election gun has been fired. It's to be Obama versus McCain. Peter and Ben are in Washington. Let's discuss how we do the story today. </unknownNode><unknownNode>There are a few other stories around today. There's the Polish attacks story, PMQs, Darling's evidence on 10p tax to the Treasury Select Committee, another 42 day meeting of Labour backbenchers tonight, the future of the NHS, and David Hockney's latest outburst. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Playout? Mel Ferrer?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Robert </unknownNode><unknownNode>From tonight's presenter, Gavin Esler:</unknownNode><unknownNode>Clinton and Obama Is it finally the end of the road for Hillary? And have the Democrats chosen the right person? We'll have the latest from the final US primaries. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Eat your Greens Is going vegetarian the answer to the world's food problems? Yvo de Boer, the head of the UN climate agency, thinks so. We'll discuss. Click here to join the debate</unknownNode><unknownNode>The Winners Some people are doing well out of the credit crunch. Who are they? And would they lend me a tenner? Watch last night's report on The Losers</unknownNode><unknownNode>Dogs The RSPCA says we have an increasing problem with dangerous dogs. Why?</unknownNode><unknownNode>The answer to the question in yesterday's post is the 1957 Carmarthen by-election, which many Liberals regard as the nadir of their party's fortunes (they were left with just five seats in the Commons). </unknownNode><unknownNode>The wound hurt all the more for two reasons: 1) It was delivered by Megan Lloyd-George, daughter of the great Liberal Prime Minister, who had defected to the Labour Party before the 1955 General Election; and 2) One of the issues was the Suez war which the Liberal Party opposed but its candidate supported.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Prior to that there was the October 1934 Lambeth North by-election, also a loss to Labour. The last by-election loss to the Conservatives was the March 1926 Combined English Universities by-election.</unknownNode><unknownNode>If Mark Oaten is negotiating, his hand is very strong. A loss to the Conservatives at a by-election would be almost impossible for his party to explain away.</unknownNode><unknownNode>"The best solution would be for us all to become vegetarians".</unknownNode><unknownNode>So suggested the head of the UN climate agency, Yvo de Boer, who is attending UN-led climate talks in Germany this week.  He was responding to criticism that measures to tackle climate change are partly to blame for the rise in food and energy costs. Carbon-cutting biofuels, for example, use food crops to make alternatives to gasoline.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Meanwhile, Patrick Wall, chairman of the European Food Safety Authority, has questioned whether it is "morally or ethically correct" to be feeding grain to animals while people starve.  Speaking to the Times, he argued that it's time to end the EU ban on the use of animal remains to feed pigs and chickens.  Lifting the ban would allow grain to be diverted to millions of starving people.</unknownNode><unknownNode>And the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation, hosting a much publicised summit in Rome this week, has warned of global catastrophe unless food reaches parts of the world where it is needed most.</unknownNode><unknownNode>So, does the global food crisis demand a radical rethink of how we distribute food? Should we worry less about feeding our animals and prioritise getting grain to people suffering food shortages - even if that affects the availability of meat?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Is it time for us all to become vegetarian? Leave your comments below.</unknownNode><unknownNode>And remember when Ethical Man went vegan for a month to reduce his carbon footprint?

Here's her morning e-mail to the production team:</unknownNode><unknownNode>At 10:30 tonight, we could be hours away from closure in the fight for the Democratic nomination in the US. Or we could not. But anyway, the last Democratic primaries are being held today in Montana and South Dakota. When will Hillary leave the stage? What are the super delegates going to do? Shall we discuss Bill Clinton's extraordinary comments on "the bias of the media for Obama" and his view that "this has been the most rigged coverage in modern history"?       </unknownNode><unknownNode>Forty world leaders (including Robert Mugabe) are descending on Rome to try and work out how to solve the global food crisis. What should we do on this?</unknownNode><unknownNode>The Burma Campaign has published its dirty list of companies that trade/invest with Burma. Should we name and shame them? </unknownNode><unknownNode>Ryanair has announced a 20 per cent rise in its net profits for the last financial year. But its chief executive, Michael O'Leary, says if oil prices don't fall, he only expects the airline to break even this year. Is cheap air travel dead?   </unknownNode><unknownNode>The RSPCA is worried about dangerous dogs. Are you? What does the apparent increase in ownership of dangerous dogs tell us about ourselves?   </unknownNode><unknownNode>And: Olmert is Washington - his farewell tour? Maths standards are down. We'll know the details of the 42 days concessions.    </unknownNode><unknownNode>And the upside of the downturn. Part two of our mini-series on the winners and losers in the credit-crunched world. Gillian Lacey-Solymar explains why the economic slump is good news if you sell lipsticks or cushions, and if your work-place is in need of some Dunkirk spirit. </unknownNode><unknownNode>See you in a minute, Shaminder  </unknownNode><unknownNode>From tonight's presenter, Gavin Esler:</unknownNode><unknownNode>Today's Quote for the Day comes from Gordon Brown: "I am determined that we stick to our principles." </unknownNode><unknownNode>The prime minister was speaking about government plans to allow the police to detain terror suspects for up to 42 days without charge. In taking such a stand, just what kind of risk is the prime minister running? Is there an electoral strategy behind it? Michael Crick investigates and we'll be talking to the government.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Banks in bother?</unknownNode><unknownNode>More bad news for the banking industry. Bradford and Bingley shares fell sharply today after news that it made a loss and it's blaming problems with the buy-to-let market. Could other banks be in similar trouble? And is the announcement that it has sold more than 20 per cent of the bank to an American private equity group a sign that banks are at the bottom of the market - and now is the time to buy on the cheap?</unknownNode><unknownNode>US election</unknownNode><unknownNode>Hillary Clinton keeps clocking up wins in the primaries but the mathematics still mean it is Barack Obama who will secure the Democratic nomination for president. We've a report from Peter Marshall in Washington, and I've been talking to Sandy Berger, Bill Clinton's former National Security Adviser and long-term friend of the Clinton family. Mr Berger tells me that these are the most dangerous times for a new US president since Franklin Roosevelt first took power in 1933 - faced with Mussolini, Stalin, the Rise of Hitler, and the Great Depression. What's his plan for the next president to follow?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Yves and Bo</unknownNode><unknownNode>And finally we were torn on whether to mark the death of Yves Saint Laurent or of guitar legend Bo Diddley. In the end we decided to do both. We have an interview with Yves Saint Laurent's friend and top shoe designer, Manolo Blahnik. And we'll end the show with Bo. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Is Mark Oaten trying to do a Ronaldo? One wouldn't normally compare the Lib Dem MP for Winchester with the world's greatest footballer. OK, they've both been embarrassed by the British tabloids over their private lives, but one would hardly expect the former Lib Dem leadership contender to score one goal a season, let alone 42.</unknownNode><unknownNode>No, I speak of the strange noises coming from Mr Oaten over the weekend to the effect that he may have to stand down from Parliament before the next election. He originally planned to retire from the Commons at the next election, and is currently negotiating with potential future employers. He now says his new bosses may require him to step down ahead of time. </unknownNode><unknownNode> 						Continue reading "The Ronaldo Of Westminster?" 					</unknownNode><unknownNode>Not since the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy has the number 42 caused so much discussion and confusion. But rather than being the answer to Life, the Universe and Everything, Gordon Brown is hoping it will be one of the answers to two issues: combating terrorism, and getting his leadership back on track.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Writing in the Times today, he argues that extending the number of days that terror suspects can be detained without charge from 28 to 42 days is the "right way to protect national security".  The proposal is backed by the police.</unknownNode><unknownNode>The vote, which is part of the Counter-Terrorism bill, takes place next week, and the prime minister hopes he will have persuaded enough potential rebels - and made sufficient compromises - to avoid defeat.</unknownNode><unknownNode>But as the whole issue of terror detention has generally been debated via the prism of Westminster, have ministers lost touch with the views of the country? Are the majority of voters actually quite comfortable with 42 days as a measure to help tackle terrorism in the UK? Or should opponents of the figure, concerned about potential infringements of our civil liberties, remain defiant in the face of Gordon Brown's resolve to stick to his principles and "do the right thing"?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Our political editor Michael Crick is at Westminster with his ear to the ground - he'll be blogging for us later this afternoon and reporting for tonight's programme.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Stay up to date with his blog, and let us know your thoughts on 42 days and whether this could be the last throw of the dice for Gordon Brown.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Today's output editor is Simon Enright - here's his morning e-mail to the production team:</unknownNode><unknownNode>Hello All,</unknownNode><unknownNode>Which story will be the most important at 10.30 tonight and which one can we move forward?</unknownNode><unknownNode>MPs are back from their half-term holiday and the PLP meets this evening to discuss 42 days. Gordon Brown is offering concessions but is clearly determined to face defeat if necessary on this issue. Just how damaging could this be for him?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Bradford and Bingley have made a loss in the first few months of the year. Their share price has tumbled. But they've found an American buyer for 20% of their stock. So does that mean it is bad but this is the bottom?</unknownNode><unknownNode>We've also got an interview with Sandy Berger - former Bill Clinton advisor - ahead of the final two primaries. He's some interesting advice to give to the next US President on foreign policy.</unknownNode><unknownNode>And Madeleine Holt will do Yves Saint Laurent.</unknownNode><unknownNode>But what interviews should we do? Is there a playout? Is there a story we're missing? Mugabe? Olmert?</unknownNode><unknownNode>All the best and see you at 10.30.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Simon </unknownNode><unknownNode>Terror, consent and ticking timebombs</unknownNode><unknownNode>The last Briton in Guantanamo Bay has just been charged with terrorism under its Military Tribunal. Binyam Mohammed - who says he was tortured in Morocco under extraordinary rendition - could now face the death penalty. We don't know, to be frank, if he's a terrorist. But we do know that when the very practices used by the West face eyebrow raising scrutiny, and questions of legality, the so-called War on Terror itself is in danger of being undermined.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Tonight we talk to the author of Terror and Consent - a philosophical roadmap for fighting the often intangible issue of terrorism. We ask Philip Bobbitt what methods should and could be used to protect ourselves whilst retaining the values that allow civil societies to hold their heads high.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>Oil</unknownNode><unknownNode>Earlier this week the prime minister called this week the "third great oil shock" of our times. It's been an extraordinary few days. New price highs, the first haulier protests against petrol tax since 2000, pan-European demonstrations and promises by the government to help those in fuel poverty. We look back on whether we've just witnessed what might - in years to come - be seen as the week oil tipped us into recession. We'll also be speaking to a man who believes this will be the last oil shock.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Smoking</unknownNode><unknownNode>It's the perfect script for a John Grisham novel - the underdog abandoned by a corrupt government - and the elaborate conspiracy to cover it all up. Tonight we look at the revelations that Harold Macmillan - in the year before he became prime minister - opposed a public health campaign on the dangers of smoking. He argued, as chancellor, that he needed the tax revenue from cigarettes and didn't believe the scientific evidence of the time was strong enough anyway. But it's enough to make you wonder what dangers we're ignoring today on the basis of useful taxation revenue. </unknownNode><unknownNode/><unknownNode>If there has been one dominating theme this week, it's been oil.  The price of it.  The tax on it.  The availability of it.  It could be enough to make or break a government - and not only in the UK.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Thousands of fishermen in Spain have gone on strike today over the rising cost of fuel - there's also unrest in other parts of Europe.</unknownNode><unknownNode>And of course, the week began with protests in the UK, as lorry drivers took to the streets over government plans for a  two pence rise in fuel tax.</unknownNode><unknownNode>The government has said it is listening.  The prime minister and his chancellor, Alistair Darling, have met with oil producers to discuss an increase in production.</unknownNode><unknownNode>And fuel poverty is another factor on the government's well-greased oil radar - plans were unveiled today aimed at helping people on low incomes pay their fuel bills.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Are we in the middle of the third great oil shock?  Newsnight will debate tonight - but we'd like to hear your stories of how the price of oil has affected your behaviour.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Our colleagues on the Have Your Say site have also been collating views on the fuel poverty plans, and you can watch Newsnight's coverage of the week's oil-related stories on iPlayer (UK viewers only).</unknownNode><unknownNode>Post your thoughts here... </unknownNode><unknownNode>From today's output editor, Robert Morgan:</unknownNode><unknownNode>Hello everyone,</unknownNode><unknownNode>We've got a few good stories around today. There's the continuing fuel prices story, Brown's travails, 42 days, and the AQ Khan interview. The Macmillan story is quite extraordinary. Peter Marshall also has a really strong story for tonight which I'll tell you more about in the meeting. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Do come to the meeting with ideas on how to do these or any other stories.</unknownNode><unknownNode>See you in a minute,</unknownNode><unknownNode>Robert</unknownNode><unknownNode>From tonight's presenter, Emily Maitlis:</unknownNode><unknownNode>Overpopulation</unknownNode><unknownNode>Have you noticed that farmers are unusually quiet these days? After years of understandable frustration over Foot and Mouth, Mad Cow disease and supermarket-squeezed margins, the National Farmers' Union has admitted that "productive agriculture" is back on the agenda. In other words, food prices are high and they're not coming down any time soon.</unknownNode><unknownNode>A top level report has said the cost of food could remain at record levels for the next decade. So tonight, we ask the big question: too little food? Too little fuel? Or just too many of us? We'll be debating the taboo subject of overpopulation.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Detention</unknownNode><unknownNode>When ministers start talking about "consensus" over controversial issues, the rest of us start wondering about U-turns. Today, a Home Office minister announced there might be concessions on the 42-day detention issue. We'll be looking at what these might be and what they say about Gordon Brown's relationship with his backbenchers.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>North Korea</unknownNode><unknownNode>An estimated 200,000 North Koreans are living illegally on the Chinese border. Food shortages in their country means an ever greater chance of starvation, and when your life is at risk, you risk your life. Tonight, an extraordinarily powerful film from the North Korea border where we document the flow of human traffic and what it tells us about the society that remains possibly the most closed in the world. </unknownNode><unknownNode>A Genuine Hitler?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Ever wondered what a genocidal maniac would choose to paint in his spare time? If you're looking for a portrayal of an evil mind, you won't find it here. The works of one Adolf Hitler are pure and insipid banality. Yet they've inspired the Chapman Brothers - best known for their work "Hell" - to rework his paintings and ask "If Hitler was a Hippy How Happy Would We Be". It's not as crass as it sounds.</unknownNode><unknownNode>As summer approaches we thought it was about time we revisited the row we got into late last year with the influential right-leaning think tank Policy Exchange.

The police files from that event  are considered too sensitive to release. But Newsnight has obtained, under Freedom of Information, a stack of police files relating to the much bigger anti-war demonstration of October that  year.

Is this mid-term blues for Labour? Or is it something much more significant, the beginning of the end of the Brown administration? The end of New Labour as David Cameron describes it.  We'll hear from the government, and Labour backbenchers as well as the opposition.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Gavin</unknownNode><unknownNode>  </unknownNode><unknownNode>Good morning. Here's today's e-mail to the production team from output editor Simon Enright:</unknownNode><unknownNode>Crewe was not just a huge kick in the teeth for Gordon Brown but also a positive endorsement for Cameron. We should explore where this leaves the political landscape today. With such a strong by-election turnout and such a huge swing to the Conservatives what can Labour do to recover ahead of a general election? And just what kind of do is Gordon Brown in and can Labour put an electoral coalition back together? We should assess all this today.</unknownNode><unknownNode>But what other stories should we do? Ban ki-Moon says all aid workers are now allowed into Burma... Really? Who is the Exeter bomber and did someone put him up to this.</unknownNode><unknownNode>The review team are in Cannes for their annual assessment of the latest films</unknownNode><unknownNode>Simon</unknownNode><unknownNode>A turning point?

We'll also be going in search of the most significant by-election victory since the war - you can make your suggestion here.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Oil A wise Middle Eastern sage Sheikh Yamani once noted that the Stone Age did not come to an end as a result of a shortage of stones and the oil age would not come to an end because of a shortage of oil.

It's that rare chance for the electorate to give the government a kicking, to make them listen, but not change the administration.</unknownNode><unknownNode>My first memory is of the local TV presenter, Austin Mitchell, putting down his microphone and knocking on doors in Grimsby. It was a marginal seat and a worried Labour government threw all their resources at holding it. Austin Mitchell did win, just - and is still an MP. But unnoticed, the voters of Ashfield in Derbyshire took against the government and handed that much safer Labour seat to the Conservatives. Needless to say that loss didn't feature so much on Yorkshire Telly.</unknownNode><unknownNode>For every party there must be a favourite win. If you're a Scottish Nationalist you won't forget the dramatic wins in Glasgow Govan - they took it twice in by-elections from Labour. Or for sheer television drama, Labour supporters surely can't forget the result in Dudley West that broke Peter Snow's Swingometer.</unknownNode><unknownNode>But surely the by-election masters are the Liberal Democrats. Simon Hughes began the recent trend by turning yellow the safe Labour seat of Bermondsey, with what many remember as a brutally efficient campaign. The 80s, 90s and also in recent years have seen Liberal Democrats "Winning Here" in Greenwich, Eastbourne, Newbury, and most recently Sarah Teather in Brent East.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Could Crewe and Nantwich be the Conservative totem that marks a sea change in British politics?

James McGee was held for investigating what he knew to be obscene and violent attacks on members of the opposition by Mugabe's ruling Zanu PF party. He graphically describes what he saw first hand  - the vicious attacks on old women and young men alike - and his own response to the authorities that tried to detain him. Yet more proof of these attacks comes from the British journalist Peter Oborne who recently emerged from Zimbabwe with first hand accounts and the pictures to prove it. As the authorities set a date for the presidential run-off, finally, we bring you these distressing but crucial testimonies to the ongoing Mugabe reign of fear. </unknownNode><unknownNode> China and Burma: One natural disaster with a death toll reaching into the tens of thousands is hard enough to contemplate.

Now 30 years later I am still here and have updated it, put in colour pictures and reprinted it for the 100th Anniversary.</unknownNode><unknownNode>In 1900 the Prince of Wales, who would later become King Edward VII, went to the Paris Exhibition and when he became king suggested to his government that we hold an exhibition with France which would help to promote Entente Cordiale between the two countries. </unknownNode><unknownNode>In 1906 plans got under way, a site was found on farmland in Shepherds Bush. Work started in early 1907. Some 100 buildings were erected. At the height of construction 4,000 men by day and 2,000 men by night worked to get the exhibition ready for the 14 May 1908.</unknownNode><unknownNode/><unknownNode>Olympics</unknownNode><unknownNode>In 1906 Italy was due to host the Olympics but had to cancel after Mount Vesuvius erupted and caused widespread damage around Naples. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Britain was then asked to stage the Games and a stadium was built into the exhibition site. The cost of building the stadium was &pound;75,000 and it stood until 1985. These Games were a great success and Britain won 56 gold medals and the US 23 gold medals.</unknownNode><unknownNode>During the exhibition members of the British Empire came and showed their countries produce and machinery. Visitors could visit Pavilions of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, India, Ceylon with France, Algeria and its other colonies. Britain and France had a pavilion showing Arts and Women's work. There was a complete Irish village, which had all Irish Colleens working in it and visitors could kiss the Blarney Stone.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Flip Flap</unknownNode><unknownNode>One of the main attractions was the Flip Flap. It had two arms 150ft long with a carriage at the end which could carry up to 40 people at a time. It took three minutes and 20 seconds for the journey from one side to the other and cost six pence. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Three songs were composed about the Flip Flap and could be heard in the London Music Halls. There was a Scenic Mountain Railway, Canadian Toboggan Run and Spiral Ride and many other attractions.</unknownNode><unknownNode>The Exhibition was open from 11am until 11pm, Monday to Saturday from 14 May until 31 October 1908. In the bandstands around the exhibition regimental bands played throughout the day. Visitors paid one shilling (5p) to see the exhibition and when it closed more than 8.2 million people had seen the exhibition.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Other exhibitions were held on the site in 1909, 1910, 1911, 1912, and 1914. The stadium was used for greyhound racing from 1927 until 1984. Today the BBC has offices and studios on what was once the Court of Honour and the stadium.</unknownNode><unknownNode>The Newsnight film on the Great White City will be broadcast on Wednesday night. If We would love to here from anyone who has family recollections of the exhibition on either side of the Channel. Please get in touch.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Today's programme producer is Dan Kelly - here's his morning e-mail to the production team...</unknownNode><unknownNode>Good Morning everybody.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Some strong stories today. Tomorrow the government unveils a draft Queen's speech, what will this amount to, and is this the beginning of Brown's fight back?  There could also be a compensation package on 10p announced this afternoon - what will the PLP and voters make of it? If the economy is the single biggest reason for the government's current problems - more bad news on that front today.  CPI Inflation has jumped to 3% from 2.5% in March - Paul Mason is on the case.

He was killed on Saturday morning in London when broken glass from an apparently unprovoked attack at a baker's shop lodged in his neck.</unknownNode><unknownNode>His death is the 13th teenage murder in London this year. The first pledge made by Boris Johnson, when he became Mayor of London, was to tackle the culture of teenage violence in the capital, and yesterday - at a global Day of Prayer - he reiterated his commitment.</unknownNode><unknownNode>But the problem is certainly not confined to London - last summer Rhys Jones, just 11 years old, was shot dead in Liverpool by two youths.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Tonight, we'll be discussing the ease with which teenagers turn to violence and how best to change the culture that breeds it.</unknownNode><unknownNode> China's earthquake</unknownNode><unknownNode>South West China has suffered its worst earthquake for 30 years, and several thousand people have been killed in the south-western province of Sichuan alone, according to the official Xinhua news agency.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Many were buried as schools, factories and dormitories collapsed in the force of the quake with a magnitude of 7.8.  Several hundred are buried in two collapsed chemical plants. China's President Hu Jintao has called for all out rescue efforts after the quake, the reverberations of which were felt 900 miles away in Beijing.</unknownNode><unknownNode>We'll have the latest from China on the devastation and the rescue effort, and what the government's response tells us about China in 2008. </unknownNode><unknownNode> Gordon's future</unknownNode><unknownNode>"Psychologically flawed."</unknownNode><unknownNode>Do you remember when that description of Gordon Brown was attributed to Alistair Campbell? Wrongly, Campbell says.</unknownNode><unknownNode>It was back in 1998 but the idea that Gordon sat "gathering his brows like a gathering storm nursing his wrath to keep it warm" (apologies to Burns) for the whole of the Blair years has not been dispelled by his demeanour as PM, and certainly not by the trio of autobiographies from Lord Levy, John Prescott and Cherie Blair.</unknownNode><unknownNode>And we know that his most recent travails over a Scottish referendum on Independence have put him in a very black mood. This weekend the Labour backbencher Frank Field said that he had been at the receiving end of a Brown rage in the past, and that he should not lead Labour to the next election - those closest to him should tell him when is the best time to go. We'll be gazing into Gordon Brown's future.</unknownNode><unknownNode> The cost of living</unknownNode><unknownNode>...and inflation.

The dignity with which the parents of Jimmy Mizen have spoken about him and the horrible way in which he died is striking. Sadly they are not the only parents to be dealing with the death of their teenage children AND it appears to be other teenagers who are carrying out the killing. Stopping these awful crimes was one of the main promises of Boris Johnson but how would you do it? Who are the people best placed to know and can we get them to debate on the programme?</unknownNode><unknownNode>But there are other things around... Burma, Gordon Brown's state of mind - does it matter if he's enjoying himself or not? Embryology debate?</unknownNode><unknownNode>We also have a piece trying to measure the real cost of inflation.

The World Food Programme sent supplies into Rangoon today - but Burmese officials confiscated it. Tonight, we try to get inside the minds of one of the most unmalleable military regimes in the world, and ask what they're really thinking.

When there is so much evidence about the harm they cause, why do we need another review/enquiry into them, can you not just take the decision to ban them?        The simple answer is that biofuels have the potential to provide low carbon sources of fuel.  That is not to say that all biofuels do - for example the science points much more strongly to sugar rather than corn based fuels.  But the potential is serious.  We are alive to the dangers and indeed the Prime Minster recently wrote to Japan's Prime Minister Fukuda (as chair of the G8) on the issue.  As a result, a UN Taskforce has been set up. The Government has also called for Professor Ed Gallagher, the former CEO of the Environment Agency, to review the indirect impacts of biofuels.  He will publish his review in June and the findings will inform Government policy on biofuels. In the meantime the Government is fully involved in the development of sustainability criteria for biofuels in the EU and at the wider international level. The UK is among the world leaders in this field.  The Government is also providing some support for technology development for biofuels and is considering what further measures may be required.    </unknownNode><unknownNode> 2.  emptyend wrote:  How is a low-carbon economy compatible with calling for more production from OPEC? Why has this Government been frittering away the inheritance of North Sea oil and discouraging further exploration by sharply raising North Sea oil taxes two years ago?        There is important difference between short term problems and long term solutions.  As I set out in my speech on Wednesday the mismatch of supply and demand that leads to high oil prices needs to be addressed by containing demand (by finding alternatives). The Government is also in the short term working with industry to address North Sea oil and gas reserves. Through the successful PILOT forum, our licensing innovations and the fallow initiative we have seen both higher levels of exploration and development of reserves that would not previously have been realised. We are also working with industry to unlock the gas potential West of Shetland. Treasury officials are currently consulting with industry on whether there is a need for any special measures to incentivise development of marginal discoveries, including the currently "stranded" gas reserves West of Shetland.    </unknownNode><unknownNode> 3.   Tabasco1 wrote:  It will fall to you, Mr Miliband, to present the UK case to the Chinese and Indians that they should not build coal-fired power stations without operational carbon capture technology fitted from the outset. As it is your government is planning to give the green light to unabated coal-fired power stations in the UK. If this policy is not reversed, will you not - to use Nye Bevan's phrase about negotiations with the Soviets - be going into the conference chamber naked?      As energy prices continue to rise and energy security becomes both a foreign and domestic policy priority across the countries of the world, nations are increasingly turning to coal as a flexible, cheap and secure energy option. The IEA has predicted that by 2050 global energy demand will have increased by around 50% with significant portions of that coming from the emerging economies of India and China and based around their considerable reserves of coal.  We will not be able to get a global deal on climate unless we can find a way of letting India, China and others continue to burn coal.   As the Stern Review identified, carbon capture and storage is the key technology to allow us to continue to use coal.  This is one reason why the UK's work on carbon capture and storage is so important. We are working towards the world's first commercial-scale demonstration project of carbon capture and storage on post-combustion coal.  This should pave the way for improvements and cost reductions in this technology, making it more attractive and accessible for economies such as China and India to take up.       4.  rdrake98 wrote:  What's the best book you've read that puts the case, from a scientific point of view, that global warming isn't a crisis that needs the attention of policy makers? If you cannot name such a book, what is the best book on policy that argues that even if the view presented by the IPCC to policy makers is broadly correct, most of the current suggested policy measures are likely to be futile or counterproductive?  What was the best argument that you read against increased production of biofuels at least a year or more ago?  If you have trouble answering the last, don't you think you should soon have better answers to the first two?  Lastly, if books on science are too hard, are you still sure it was wise to say that you would not even watch the documentary "The Great Global Warming Swindle" when it came out in March of last year? (There were some excellent scientists on it. Of course the argument was a little simplified, as you'd expect in such a documentary. That's the why the initial questions were about the best books.)     </unknownNode><unknownNode>I have just read Nigel Lawson's book arguing against the conventional wisdom on climate change - so that is the most recent.  He is not a scientist but summarises the argument against. I think the IPCC and other books - the non scientific summary in The Weather Makers is good - outweigh his arguments. The Great Global Warming Swindle interviewed some impressive scientists - but since the programme aired, some of those scientists have been making it known that they were misrepresented, taken out of context, and misled on the purpose of the programme.  For example, Professor Carl Wunsch, from MIT, has said he was "completely misrepresented" by the programme.        5.  bookhimdano wrote:  Why are up to 50% of planning applications for solar panels being turned down? Why have the micro generation grants stopped? Why have taxes been raised on vegetable oil to make it more expensive than diesel? We have hundreds of acres of empty roof and garden space for panels, windmills and heat pumps yet the planners obstruct citing it's 'out of character'. Well they didn't have those things 100 years ago so of course it's 'out of character. How mad is that.       The situation isn't as mad as you suggest!  Recent changes to planning requirements for microgeneration mean that from 6 April 2008 the majority of micro-generation technologies are covered by permitted development, with the exception of Air Source Heat Pumps and Wind Turbines. This means the majority of technologies will not require people to apply for specific planning permission. Microgeneration grants have not stopped.  The Low Carbon Buildings Programme Phase 1 household stream, with the remaining &pound;10 million budget, was recently extended to June 2010 for new applications or as long as funds are available, whichever is sooner.  We are currently seeing a steady flow of applications and the programme is making good progress.   There's more information on this at www.lcbp.org.uk.     6.  Considering how much utility bills and basic living costs have already risen, how will private companies be prevented from passing on the costs of reducing their carbon footprints to the public?       We've got a number of initiatives in place to help people who are seeing their fuel bills increasing -- including providing grants for vulnerable people through Warm Front, increasing the Winter Fuel Payment, and most importantly the obligation on energy suppliers to improve the energy efficiency of their customers' homes. From this year, energy companies will have to double that effort.  Between now and 2011, we're requiring them to spend around &pound;3 billion on everything from low energy light bulbs and insulation to helping people install microgeneration -- both cutting emissions, and the fuel bills of millions of people. Every pound invested by energy companies to date has benefited their customers by at least &pound;9.  I'd encourage anyone interested in this, or in accessing other grants and advice on cutting their energy bills and the environmental footprint of their homes, to call the 'Act on CO2' advice line.

He constructed some of the most ornate buildings Britain has ever seen. 140 acres of marshy farmland were acquired and within 18 months a team of up to 12,000 workers had built 20 extraordinary palaces (complete with a central lagoon where you could take a trip on a swan boat), 120 exhibition buildings, an entire Irish village, and a scenic railway.

What guest suggestions have you got? Any suggestions for a playout?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Dan</unknownNode><unknownNode>"Gordon shouldn't smile - it looks unnatural" </unknownNode><unknownNode>That was the advice from one former minister last week. Today, he bravely attempted one, as he admitted to a 'night of disappointment'.  If ever there was a day our Mystery Cat would have preferred to be elsewhere, it was probably now. And indeed, if there was ever a day Labour colleagues would have preferred him to be elsewhere, it was probably now. </unknownNode><unknownNode>The local elections results in England and Wales show meltdown for Labour - with the party pushed into 3rd place. And as we await the results of the London Mayoral Race - the hottest ticket in town - might Ken kick that Mystery Cat where it hurts? So what of the Boris and Ken race? Well as I write, rumours abound and fact is scarce - the counting is only half done. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Some commentators predict a landslide for Boris. Some predict we may not even know the results until after we go on air this evening. Significantly, no one has predicted a landslide victory for Ken but all that could change. We'll bring you the key players and the analysis right here. </unknownNode><unknownNode>And what of the Tories? A momentous night - with a projected share of the vote of an impressive 44%. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Tonight we'll ask whether this is the beginning of the serious climb back for the Conservatives. Could a win for Boris prefigure a win for David Cameron? Are voters in London 'trying out' Tory leadership to see what it feels like after all this time?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Michael Crick, David Grossman and Paul Mason will take us around the country, to Old Labour heartlands, new Tory and Lib Dem gains, and of course inside City Hall in London to gauge the political climate exactly 11 years to the day since Labour came to power. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Join us at 10.30pm on what has been a truly extraordinary day for British politics. Emily</unknownNode><unknownNode>Liz Gibbons is today's programme producer - here's her early email to the team.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Hello: </unknownNode><unknownNode>So we have 40 minutes to fill, which shouldn't be too hard. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Michael Crick and Hugh are heading back from Bury to package in London - they will look at the extent of the Labour "meltdown" and differing views on how Brown can regain the initiative. If he can regain it at all that is.</unknownNode><unknownNode>David and Thea are at City Hall - they can package the events of the day, such as they are, editing at Milbank. But we won't get the mayoral result till late. Perhaps even later than 9pm. It looks like Boris will win. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Paul and Vara have gone to Nuneaton - a council which Labour held for 33 years until last night when they lost it to the Tories. Two BNP councillors also elected there last night. Cameron is due there mid-morning. Good place to gauge how grassroots Labour voters/middle England are feeling.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Do we need a Ken obit? </unknownNode><unknownNode>In terms of lives, the panel are on standby and we should be in a good position to get some top news-making interviews.

They wanted to know, I said I'm from Bury, And St Peter did stare, He said step inside lass, You're the first one from there.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Watch Michael's report here.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Elections Dear viewers - Voting is continuing in the local elections in England and Wales. Polling stations will have closed by the time Newsnight is on air tonight and results will be starting to come in.  Political Editor, Michael Crick will be in Bury, Lancashire and David Grossman will be following the mayoral contest in London with the latest news and analysis. We'll also have fascinating results of a BBC / ICM Election poll. Leading politicians from all three main parties will join us in the studio to discuss how they've performed at the elections.    Kyle Fisher A babysitter serving life for murdering a neighbour's child has been released on bail, after having her conviction quashed. Suzanne Holdsworth, who's 37, had been found guilty of killing two-year-old Kyle Fisher by smashing his head against a banister. But the Appeal Court ordered a retrial after hearing that the boy had been prone to epilepsy, and could have died from a seizure.  John Sweeney has followed the case closely for Newsnight. He has the latest developments for us tonight.    Austria Are Elizabeth Fritzl and her children - abused and hidden for almost a quarter of a century - also victims of Austria's culture of secrecy, and even the country's state of mind? A former tenant of Josef Fritzl, who has confessed to confining his daughter and fathering her seven children, claims he heard noises and asked Fritzl what they were, only to be told it was the basement gas heater. Newsnight's Robin Denselow is in the small Austrian town of Amstetten to try to find out how such horror was never detected, and the impact it has had on the country. The Austrian Chancellor has announced a campaign to repair Austria's image abroad, but is it a period of analysis within the country that is needed?

About 4,000 seats will be decided. It's the first big electoral test for Gordon Brown as Prime Minister. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Jeremy Vine from the BBC Election programme is going to give us a run down of the key electoral battlegrounds and we'll have an ICM poll for tonight. Michael and Hugh are in the North of England. David and Myranda are in London. We'll need to chase up guests from the three main political parties. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Robin Denselow is in Austria examining what the Fritzl case tells us about the country and its past.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Other stories include the Bank of England report, and the Holdsworth appeal.

She herself was abducted at the age of 10 and locked in a cellar for eight years. In her interview with Robin Denslow, she talks about her terrifying ordeal, offers advice to the victims of Josef Fritzl and questions whether Austria's role in the Second World War has had a lasting impact on attitudes to women and violence in the country.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>Mayoral Elections We are also on the election trail with Ken, Boris and Brian as they battle to win control of London.

The Fed will decide tonight whether to cut interest rates again, and new GDP data will help us to assess the state of the American economy. David Blanchflower of the MPC thinks that Britain is following every stage of the US downturn with a year long time lag - US house prices have fallen by 25%, he thinks they could fall by a third here. What guests could we have on both sides of the Atlantic? Filming ideas?</unknownNode><unknownNode>David Grossman has a piece on the Mayoral race, and we have a live interview with Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg which will need a set up.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Austria remains fascinating, and Gillian has been working on a piece about which businesses flourish during an economic downturn. We should also watch reaction to Brown's admission that he made "mistakes" on the 10p tax - could well come up in PMQs.</unknownNode><unknownNode>What ideas and thoughts have you got? </unknownNode><unknownNode>Dan</unknownNode><unknownNode>Afghanistan</unknownNode><unknownNode>Tonight a Newsnight exclusive - the inside story of the British mission in Musa Qala. The battle for control of the Afghan town has come to epitomise the trial between the British Army and its Taliban enemy in Helmand province. Our diplomatic editor Mark Urban spent nine days with British troops trying to win over suspicious locals in a town where there is still a lot of support for the Taliban. Don't miss his epic report tonight. </unknownNode><unknownNode> Pole numbers: The numbers game is traditionally a mug's game when it comes to immigration. We've seen that from government figures in the past. We've had a sneak peak at a new report on Polish migrants which is due out tomorrow - assessing the extent of Polish immigration to the UK. A lot has happened since our reporter Tim Whewell went to Crewe almost three years ago to find how a wave of Polish migrants had changed the town. We'll reconvene our panel of immigration story 'interpreters' to ask how this latest twist is likely to be portrayed in the wider media. </unknownNode><unknownNode> More Punch less Judy David Cameron has proudly presented a neat U-turn of his own. He admitted on the Today programme this morning that he's failed to kick the Punch and Judy habit  and keep that kind of haranguing politics from parliament. Calling the PM a 'loser' at PMQ's last week possibly made the point for him. Tonight, however, with just 24 hours left till the end of electioneering we will be assessing the Conservatives' chances in the local elections and in the race to be London mayor. We'll be talking to the senior Tory running their campaign who isn't - amazingly - a former member of the Bullingdon Club. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Amstetten: And we'll bring you the latest in the most macabre story any of us here can ever remember covering - the breathtaking inhumanity of one father. Austrian police have been describing what state the recovered children are in and who else might have known about the actions of Josef Fritzl.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Do join me at 10:30pm</unknownNode><unknownNode>Emily     </unknownNode><unknownNode>Have you applied for a postal vote for this week's local elections and not received a ballot paper?

Lots already set to run today - including Mark Urban's epic from Afghanistan. Plus we have an interview with a leading Conservative (identity to be confirmed) on the local elections. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Which leaves us room for one or one and a half other items - at the news-y end of the spectrum</unknownNode><unknownNode>What are you interested in? </unknownNode><unknownNode>Keen to talk about how we could take all the strands in the oil story into a coherent piece.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Guantanamo Torture Techniques:</unknownNode><unknownNode>Guantanamo Torture Techniques:</unknownNode><unknownNode>Tonight we bring you the first ever television interview with Lieutenant Colonel Diane Beaver. She was the lawyer who approved interrogation techniques for use on Guantanamo Bay prisoners that were new to the military and - many would say - both morally reprehensible and illegal under international law. Diane Beaver was acting with the higher authority of the Bush administration. She was a junior advocate and was under orders. So just how far up the ladder of the Bush administration did the buck stop? We take a look at the decisions which allowed sexual humiliation, sleep deprivation and waterboarding and hear how administration officials are now wide open to an international war crimes investigation........ </unknownNode><unknownNode>But first tonight, </unknownNode><unknownNode>Grangemouth:</unknownNode><unknownNode>An oil refinery is not an easy place to be spontaneous. A strike by workers may or may not be called off - in many ways, it's irrelevant: the plant itself is already in the process of shutting down. For the first time the facility will be completely closed. As a result, BP has started making preparations to close down the Forties pipeline that delivers 30% of the UK's daily oil output. The company has warned that it could take up to three weeks for the plant to get back up and running at 100% capacity. The shutdown embodies all the concerns so often raised now about Britain's energy supplies: How secure is our energy supply? Are we too dependent on too few sources? And what effect will this have on a government - already looking shaky in the polls - if drivers decide to take matters into their own hands and fill up their cars in panic? We hope to be speaking to the energy minister Malcolm Wicks.  </unknownNode><unknownNode> Darfur:</unknownNode><unknownNode>After Rwanda, leaders of the civilized world insisted the like would never be tolerated again. Insisted, indeed, that the international community would never stand by allowing that kind of atrocity to continue. So why have we seen five years of fighting - and 300,000 deaths - in Darfur? This evening, Robin Denselow takes stock of the African conflict the world forgot.</unknownNode><unknownNode> Do join me tonight at 10:30pm on BBC2</unknownNode><unknownNode>Emily   </unknownNode><unknownNode>On 2 December 2002 Donald Rumsfeld signed a memorandum authorising 18 techniques of interrogation not previously allowed by the United States. </unknownNode><unknownNode>In Torture Team leading QC Philippe Sands traces the life of the memorandum and examines the use of torture at Guantanamo and the US airbase at Bagram. </unknownNode><unknownNode>He also and explores issues of individual responsibility. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Extract from: Torture Team </unknownNode><unknownNode>Deception, Cruelty and the Compromise of Law</unknownNode><unknownNode>Published by Penguin Books </unknownNode><unknownNode>Only a few pieces of paper can change the course of history. On  Tuesday, 2 December 2002 Donald Rumsfeld signed one that did. </unknownNode><unknownNode>It was an ordinary day. The Secretary of Defense wasn't travelling.  No immediate decisions were needed on Iraq and Washington  awaited Saddam's declaration on weapons of mass destruction. </unknownNode><unknownNode>The only notable public event in the Secretary's diary for that day was the President's visit to the Pentagon to sign a Bill to put the Pentagon in funds for the next year. Signings are big, symbolic public events.</unknownNode><unknownNode>They offer an opportunity to lavish praise and on this occasion neither man showed restraint. The Secretary of Defense introduced President Bush effusively as our 'leader in the global war on terrorism'. The President thanked Mr Rumsfeld warmly, for his  candour, and for doing such a fabulous job for the American people.  The United States faced unprecedented challenges, Bush told a large and enthusiastic audience, and terror was one of them. The United States would respond to these challenges, and it would do so in  the 'finest traditions of valour'. And then he signed a large increase in the Defense budget. </unknownNode><unknownNode>That same day, elsewhere in the Pentagon, a less public event took place for which there was no comment, no publicity, no fanfare. With a signature and a few scrawled words Donald Rumsfeld cast aside America's international obligations and reneged on the tradition of valour to which President Bush had referred. Principles for the conduct of interrogation, dating back more than a century to President Lincoln's famous instruction of 1863 that 'military necessity does not admit of cruelty', were discarded. His approval of new and aggressive interrogation techniques would produce devastating consequences. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Liz Gibbons is today's programme producer - here's her early email to the team.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Hi all </unknownNode><unknownNode>We have a film from Peter and Ben looking at some of the revelations about Guantanamo Bay outlined in Philippe Sands' new book: the piece includes the first ever TV interview with the lawyer who drew up plans for the use of certain interrogation techniques.</unknownNode><unknownNode>So we're looking for a lead and a third item. </unknownNode><unknownNode>What do you think? Should we take more of a look at Brown - in advance of what's likely to be a weekend of extensive newspaper analysis about the state of his leadership? Or should we use the OFT cigarettes announcement as an opportunity to look at "Rip Off Britain"?</unknownNode><unknownNode>We have the offer of an interview with the Serbian PM, who's in town. What would you want to ask him?</unknownNode><unknownNode>And I am keen to do something to mark the 5th Anniversary of the Darfur conflict. What do you think it should be?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Liz </unknownNode><unknownNode>The new Register of MPs Interests, published today (24 April), lists 106 MPs who employ their wives, husbands, or other relatives, and pay them from their Parliamentary Staffing allowances.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>This is the first time MPs have had the opportunity to declare this, though it won't be compulsory to do so until 1 August.  Until then, it's still voluntary whether MPs register such details or not.</unknownNode><unknownNode>A lot of MPs seem to have delayed registration, perhaps because it's such a sensitive issue.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>Perhaps the most glaring omission so far is the Speaker Michael Martin (who employs his daughter as a constituency case-worker), which may not go down well with his critics when he is officially overseeing the enquiries into reforming the whole expenses system. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Other omissions include Margaret Beckett, who employs her husband Leo, and Sir Ming Campbell who employs his wife Elspeth.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>Several MPs are revealed to employ more than one relative, whilst the new leader of the Democratic Unionist Party, Peter Robinson, and his wife Iris, who is also an MP, have turned politics into a real family business. Peter Robinson himself employs both their son and daughter-in-law, whilst Iris Robinson employs another son, and their daughter.  So six Robinsons in all are paid by Parliament in one way or another.  I can see headlines along the lines of "something Family Robinson" in tomorrow's papers.</unknownNode><unknownNode>It's also interesting to see that the former Conservative leader Michael Howard employs his wife Sandra as a part-time secretary.  I'm surprised she has the time with her new novel-writing career.  (I've just read her first novel, Glass Houses, by the way, and rather enjoyed it.)</unknownNode><unknownNode>Last February, when this issue first blew up over the Derek Conway affair, Newsnight identified 96 MPs who employed relatives (see past blogs).  Many on the Newsnight list have yet to submit their details on this to the official register, but equally the register published today has furnished us with 56 more names.  So the total of names is now 152; by 1 August that total could well reach 200 or more.</unknownNode><unknownNode>The new names are:</unknownNode><unknownNode>Janet Anderson Ian Austin Adrian Bailey John Battle John Bercow Clive Betts Graham Brady Russell Brown Paul Burstow Richard Caborn William Cash Sir Patrick Cormack Stephen Crabb Claire Curtis-Thomas David Davies Paul Farrelly Paul Flynn Michael Foster (Hastings) Cheryl Gillan Robert Goodwill James Gray Sir Aan Haselhurst Michael Howard Adam Ingram Michael Jack Diana Johnson Robert Key Julie Kirkbride John MacDougall John Mann Patrick Mercer John McFall Elliot Morley Kali Mountford Andrew Murrison Mark Oaten Richard Ottaway James Paice Nick Palmer Bill Rammell Angus Robertson John Robertson Iris Robinson Peter Robinson Lee Scott Dennis Skinner Jacqui Smith Graham Stuart Ian Taylor Matthew Taylor Don Touhig Andrew Turner Mike Weir Betty Williams David Wilshire Phil Wilson</unknownNode><unknownNode>Strikes With the GCSEs on the horizon teachers from the NUT have gone on strike.

Every few years the opera world goes through a period of self-flagellation, deciding that to reach those longed-for new young audiences it has to DO SOMETHING RADICAL.

Hillary Clinton is tipped to win - but not by much. Meanwhile Barack Obama is facing a more hostile press than he has at any other stage of the race.  Details of his relationship with a Chicago property dealer who is facing corruption charges have come to the fore, as has his continued backing of his controversial pastor. Peter Marshall's been to Chicago to assess whether any of this mud is beginning to stick. </unknownNode><unknownNode>And we'll have the latest from Philadelphia on the state of the vote.</unknownNode><unknownNode>The government is still desperately trying to appease potential rebels over the 10p tax row. Have their latest attempts borne fruit? David Grossman is looking in to it. </unknownNode><unknownNode>You may remember a film we ran some months ago featuring a former member of the Islamist group Hizbut Tahrir. Majid Nawaz had decided to leave the organisation, after becoming deeply concerned about what it stood for. He's now launched the "Quilliam Foundation" with some other former radicals, which aims to counter extremism.  We'll be hearing from them live, along with a high profile Muslim who is very critical of the foundation's aims. </unknownNode><unknownNode>And - has lap dancing become socially acceptable? There's certainly a profusion of lap dancing clubs on our high streets, and even pubs are now offering lap dancing nights. Recent licensing laws make it far easier for them to open these days.  A campaign has been launched today to try and make it harder for such establishments to start up.  We'll hear from a member of that campaign, and from the owner of a lap dancing chain. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Join Jeremy at 10.30 </unknownNode><unknownNode/><unknownNode>I am in the process of rebranding the blog for the newly expanded Chinese audience.

Chief Secretary to the Treasury Yvette Cooper told MPs that a previously-announced inquiry into the next steps for tackling child poverty would be extended to include the needs of households on low incomes without children.  Gordon Brown is expected to give details of the review when he addresses the Parliamentary Labour Party for the second time in less than a month this evening. But has the Government done enough to head off a rebellion next week? We'll be speaking to one of the leading Labour rebels.    Banks The Chancellor Alistair Darling has been giving details of the Bank of England's &pound;50bn rescue package for banks affected by the global credit crunch. The intervention will see bonds from the Treasury offered to banks in exchange for their potentially risky mortgage debts. It's hoped that the scheme will loosen up lending between banks - and consequently bolster the mortgage market. We'll be asking if taxpayers' money will be at risk. And will interest rate cuts be passed on to customers as a result?</unknownNode><unknownNode>President Carter The former US President, Jimmy Carter - who met last week with the top Hamas leaders in Syria - says Hamas is prepared to accept Israel's right to live as a neighbour in peace. He said even if Mahmoud Abbas and Ehud Olmert negotiated for the full recognition of Israel, Hamas would accept it, as long as it was approved in a Palestinian referendum. He tells us that Hamas is prepared to stick to a mutual ceasefire. See his exclusive interview on this and on the US Presidential race on the programme tonight.

Clare Fisher dropped off her two-year-old son, Kyle, with baby-sitter Suzanne Holdsworth in July 2004. Seventy five minutes later he was brain-dead. Holdsworth was convicted of murdering Kyle and is serving life in prison.  The court heard that she must have smashed his head against a banister with a force like being thrown from a car crash at 60 mph. But leading neuro-pathologist Dr Waney Squier tells Newsnight she has major concerns about the impact theory. Dr Squier points to a congenital brain abnormality and a year-old injury to the eye socket which had nothing to do with Holdsworth. Both conditions can cause fits - and fits can kill.  So Holdsworth may be innocent because no murder ever took place. John Sweeney reports on the fresh evidence that points to a possible miscarriage of justice, and on questions raised about the police investigation into Kyle's death.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Read John's article on the case here.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Robert  </unknownNode><unknownNode>UPDATE: 1516 GMT Protesters in nine cities have blockaded Carrefour stores in protest at France's diplomatic stance on Tibet.

Tonight, the prime minister means to answer it. Emboldened by successful meetings yesterday with each of the presidential candidates, he has given a speech about Global Challenges in Boston.  The world stage may be a scary place. But it's infinitely preferable, in many ways, to what he faces at home. The 10p tax revolt seems to be gathering steam. He may have stopped one if his MPs, Angela Smith, from resigning yesterday. But there are more emerging from the woodwork as we speak. We'll ask just how comfortable Gordon Brown is looking within his own party.   </unknownNode><unknownNode> RBS   Royal Bank of Scotland is about to stage the biggest rights issue in UK corporate history, asking shareholders for some &pound;10bn to shore up its financial position. It will be part of an effort to write down its exposure to US sub prime - and any other skeletons still lurking in the cupboard. And in doing so, it marks a recognition - that all has not been well but can now get better. The move has been compared by some to a confessional, others to a ruthless spring clean.  How many other banks will follow suit once the taboo is broken? And does this signal that the worst is now over?</unknownNode><unknownNode> Gwyneth Dunwoody</unknownNode><unknownNode>Also tonight we pay tribute to Gwyneth Dunwoody  who has died aged 77. In the words of one parliamentarian and friend, she was the essential 'debunker of humbug'. She will be remembered for her stubbornly principled stance, her commitment to the Labour Party, and for her formidable chairmanship of the transport select committee. A woman, who shone through an age of spin to tirelessly speak her mind.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>As many of you who've used the BBC's blogs will know, it has for some months been a deeply frustrating experience, not just for you but for us too.   The point of blogging about our programmes is to have a swift and informal conversation with our viewers. That's impossible if it takes hours to get your comment or our response through.</unknownNode><unknownNode>I'm relieved to say that as of yesterday we have a new system which should be much more robust and which I hope will usher in a new era of blogging for Newsnight.   One change is that in order to comment you'll need to register by filling in a simple form.  Once signed up, you'll be able to comment on any BBC blog using the same login.    Many of you have already commented on how it's working and one or two have suggested it's designed to introduce more censorship.   That's certainly not our intention. The aim is to encourage much more open discussion about the programme and much more interaction with the programme-makers. I'm sure it isn't perfect and that you'll let us know how it could be improved.   Thanks very much to all those contributors - the Bob Goodalls, Barrie Singletons, Mistress76UKs and many others - who have persevered through all the blog problems. Apologies for all the Error 502s, and welcome to the new era.   </unknownNode><unknownNode>Robert Morgan is today's programme producer - here's his early email to the team.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Good morning everyone,</unknownNode><unknownNode>Lots of stories around today. Brown's foreign affairs speech in Boston, RBS, the arms shipment heading for Zimbabwe, Indian cricket. Let's debate what the best stories and treatments are for today.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Robert</unknownNode><unknownNode> </unknownNode><unknownNode>Terror trial verdict</unknownNode><unknownNode>A few moments ago, the Muslim activist Abu Izzadeen and five others were found guilty on terror-related charges. Izzadeen and one of the other convicted men, Simon Keeler, have been convicted of fundraising for terrorists and inciting terrorism overseas. Both men have been the subject of a series of revelatory Newsnight reports in recent years. Our reporter Richard Watson will bring you the definitive story of the two men and of Al Muhajiroun - the organisation they were at the heart of. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Brown in the USA</unknownNode><unknownNode>The roads are repaved, the traffic's stopped, the flags are flying and the crowds have turned out in their tens of thousands to welcome the foreign visitor.  The problem is, they've come to see the Pope, not Gordon Brown.  The first mention of Gordon Brown's visit comes on page 14 of the New York Times. The second - a brief headline - states 'Brit leader visits US in Pope's shadow'.  Unfortunate clash perhaps, but then again Gordon Brown never claimed he could fill a baseball stadium and anyway, he has people to meet.  Today, he's been given audiences with Democratic Senators Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton and their Republican rival John McCain. So which of the candidates does our PM see eye to eye with? We'll be speaking to McCain's special advisor live on the programme and asking what the special relationship would look like under their stewardship. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Zimbabwe</unknownNode><unknownNode>The opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai has called for the South African President to step down as an intermediary in the election negotiations. His frustration with the process is palpable. But it is odd that his words come just as Thabo Mbeki has finally abandoned soft diplomacy to himself call for the prompt release of Zimbabwe's election result, twenty four hours after Gordon Brown demanded the same thing in the starkest terms at the UN. Is the international community's approach towards Zimbabwe changing? Will it give Mr Tsvangirai the endorsement he needs to claim victory?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Immigration: A tale of two papers</unknownNode><unknownNode>IMMIGRANTS BRING MORE CRIME - the Mail screams today. It claims to be interpreting a report by Chiefs of Police.   MIGRANT CRIME WAVE A MYTH - sang the Guardian yesterday (and some BBC bulletins too) and yes, they'd been reading exactly the same report.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Who's right? Well, having been through the report it doesn't really endorse either view - indeed it tells us very little that's new.</unknownNode><unknownNode>So why does the debate on immigration always get hijacked so quickly? And is there ever a real chance of getting to the facts, when the very word is so emotive? We'll debate that tonight with media commentators on left and right.   </unknownNode><unknownNode>Join me, at 10.30pm</unknownNode><unknownNode>Emily    </unknownNode><unknownNode>Liz Gibbons is today's programme producer - here's her early email to the team.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Hello, </unknownNode><unknownNode>So - what do you want to do? Michael Crick and Hugh are in Washington and already working on a piece about Brown's relationship with Bush  and his potential successors. He's meeting all of them today - which one really shares his world view?  </unknownNode><unknownNode>Piece will take in the Bush/Brown presser and his handshakes with the candidates. Who should we speak to off the back?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Beyond that the programme is wide open.</unknownNode><unknownNode>What could we bring to the OFT construction story, Zimbabwe, ACPO on immigration and crime? </unknownNode><unknownNode>We could do with a good end of programme talking point. What about the pope on the state of US society?

We have an authored film from the CEO of Sainsbury's Justin King who accuses the government of a tendency to leap on the green bandwagon. We have him and the government live in the studio tonight. This could be a lead but it would need a bit of teeing up to put the film in context. How could we do this? What areas should we cover?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Brown in the US Two possible today stories - the economy and Zim. Brown meets Mbeki and raises issue of Zim at the UN and then goes on to meet bankers. There may also be a BBC iv with Tsvangirai available to us. Another possibility is to throw forward to tomorrow's meeting with Bush and the presidential hopefuls. We have Crick in NY but only for 2-way really. </unknownNode><unknownNode>US Elections The lovely planning people have set up a disco with Mara Rudman (former NSA under Clinton (Bill)) who backs Clinton (Hillary) and an Obama-supporting super delegate. It's a good chance to look at the state of the Democrat race ahead just hours ahead of a key debate between the two but also to look at their foreign policy positions ahead of the meeting with Brown.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Zambia's Chinese Burn Tim Whewell and Caroline Pare have the second of their series of films on China in Africa - they look at how Zambians have turned against the Chinese businessmen who have established themselves in the country.</unknownNode><unknownNode>To Watch: news coming out of Israel about a major incident</unknownNode><unknownNode>Play out - what about the French entry to the Eurovision - sung in English?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Nothing's set in stone though so come armed with brilliant thoughts</unknownNode><unknownNode>Jasmin</unknownNode><unknownNode>On the programme last Friday I told the extraordinary story of the by-election in the Corporation of London last week - in the quaintly named ward Farringdon Within. </unknownNode><unknownNode>When the votes were counted on Wednesday night it was found that 179 people had voted, and the victorious new councilman won with a margin of 27 votes.</unknownNode><unknownNode>But then, astonishingly, on Thursday, 62 postal votes turned up late where normally they would only expect one or two postal votes to be late. Because the votes were late, they couldn&rsquo;t be counted and the Corporation didn&rsquo;t even know if they could have made a difference because under election law the votes can&rsquo;t be opened because they&rsquo;re not valid. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Sources in the Corporation suspected the postal votes had been held back by the Post Office as a result of dispute in which the Corporation was accused of not paying it&rsquo;s Free Post bill. On Friday the Post Office fervently denied this to Newsnight, insisting that they never withhold people&rsquo;s post. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Now the farce continues another batch of 58 postal votes turned up late on Monday and a further 11 this morning (Tuesday).</unknownNode><unknownNode>So, in all the Corporation received 131 late postal votes so far, compared with the 179 that were deemed to be valid &ndash; and remember the winning margin was just 27!</unknownNode><unknownNode>As you can imagine top lawyers are now trying to sort it all out, but it is another shining example of the breath-taking inadequacies of the postal voting system.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>Rising food prices, rising population, growing poverty and climate change are becoming a major problem for the world.   </unknownNode><unknownNode>Newsnight is devoting tonight&rsquo;s programme to examine this global crisis.</unknownNode><unknownNode> </unknownNode><unknownNode>We've lined up correspondents in some of the countries feeling the strain most acutely to tell us what the situation is like on the ground.    We have films by Susan Watts &ndash; on whether we need a second green revolution &ndash; and Liz MacKean - on the &pound;8bn of food we bin every year.   We&rsquo;ll also have a panel of international experts on hand to discuss the problem.   We&rsquo;d like to know what you think..   What are the solutions to these problems?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Robert Morgan is today's programme producer - here's his early email to the team.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Good morning everyone,</unknownNode><unknownNode> How do we feed the World in the future?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Rising food prices, rising population, growing poverty and climate change are becoming a major problem for the world. I hope to devote the programme today to the problems and solutions on the day an international report sets out its answers.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>We've lined up some correspondents in the main hotspots and Susan and Liz have done films. Do come to the meeting with ideas on the best people to get and how to do the top VT.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Playout ideas welcome. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Robert  </unknownNode><unknownNode>In a short series of reports and debates this week we're look at issues of sustainability and our use of natural resources. On Monday we focus on the controversy surrounding biofuel. Tuesday's programme is devoted to food. How do we feed the world in the future amid rising populations, rising food prices and climate change? We look at the issue of recent food riots in many countries and ask what the solution is to shortages. And we have a report on how much food UK families are guilty of wasting. Finally, on Wednesday, we have a personal film from the CEO of Sainsbury's, Justin King. He'll be discussing the supermarkets' role in sustainability - and why it's not all about plastic bags.</unknownNode><unknownNode>But what are your thoughts about the issues? You can join in the debates below...</unknownNode><unknownNode>Jeremy is presenting tonight's programme, and we'll start the programme with the first in a series of reports this week focusing on the rising price of food across the planet, and the unsustainability of our natural resources.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Biofuel Tonight, we look at biofuels. From tomorrow, 2.5% of all the petrol and diesel we buy at the pump must come from biofuels. That's a government target. But even before it's been enforced, the government has signalled that it's cooling on the whole idea of biofuels - amidst concerns that biofuel production is contributing to the rising price of food, and isn't proving all that environmentally friendly. The Chancellor Alistair Darling called for a review of the use of biofuels at the weekend saying, "It would be a profound mistake if we get into a situation where we are growing corn that is essential for feeding people and converting it into fuel." So why is the government insisting on the use of biofuels in petrol?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Brown Also tonight: Gordon Brown insisted today that he is focusing "every effort" on steering the economy away from recession. Meanwhile, the Shadow Chancellor George Osborne, has claimed the government's reputation for economic competence is in tatters. Who's right? And what, in policy terms, can the government actually do to prevent a recession? Paul Mason is investigating, and Michael Crick will have the latest on the rumblings from Labour backbenchers about dissatisfaction with the direction of the Brown government. </unknownNode><unknownNode>China in Africa And we have the first of a series of fascinating films from Tim Whewell in Africa - looking at the ever-growing influence of China on the continent. There are now 700 Chinese firms operating in 49 African countries. And, even though it's still classed as a developing nation, China has sunk more than &pound;12bn into developing Africa's infrastructure since the year 2000. The biggest China-in-Africa deal so far is about to be signed - between China and the Democratic Republic of Congo.  If it goes ahead, it will have a huge influence on the Congolese people - even though it's barely known about in the country. Tim has been there to find out how it will work - you can read his article here.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Join Jeremy at 10.30</unknownNode><unknownNode>Liz Gibbons is today's programme producer. Here is her early email to the team.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Good morning,</unknownNode><unknownNode>Unsustainable world?</unknownNode><unknownNode>In the first of a series this week on issues surrounding sustainability, we ask if the production of biofuels really is a "crime against humanity" as one UN official has claimed.</unknownNode><unknownNode>What else can we do? What can the government do in policy terms to illustrate that it can steer the country through an economic crisis? Is Gordon Brown's authority as PM all but destroyed, as some papers seem to claim?  What's gone wrong with the government's new domestic violence legislation?  Will we get any results from Zimbabwe today? </unknownNode><unknownNode>And we have a fascinating film from Congo - the Chinese are on the verge of signing a multi-million dollar deal with the Congolese government to mine for cobalt - in return the Chinese will build massive amounts of infrastructure - roads, hospitals etc. Will it work? Read Tim Whewell's article here.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Liz</unknownNode><unknownNode>Jersey  A former Jersey honorary policeman who admitted sexual assaults on girls has been jailed for two years.  This comes at a time when Jersey has been rocked by other allegations of child abuse and incompetence by the authorities. Robin Denselow is in Jersey for us tonight with the latest.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Spying  Poole Borough Council in Dorset has admitted using anti-terror laws to carry out surveillance of a family  they suspected of lying about living in a school catchment area. The civil rights group Liberty calls the spying disproportionate and intrusive.  We hope to be bringing together the director of Liberty in debate with the head of the Local Government Association.    DNA  A panel of experts has given its backing to scientific techniques in which evidence is extracted from tiny amounts of DNA. The panel was asked by the government to review the controversial technique, after it was criticised by the judge at the Omagh bombing trial. Our Science Editor, Susan Watts, who investigated the original doubts about the procedure assesses the implications of today's decision.     </unknownNode><unknownNode>Good morning everyone,</unknownNode><unknownNode>There are some good options on stories today. We have a strong potential story from Jersey. I'll tell you more in the meeting. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Other stories include BAE, Zimbabwe, the school spying row  and the DNA report - You can watch Susan Watts' report into low copy number DNA here.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Do come to the meeting with ideas on how to do these and other stories.</unknownNode><unknownNode>See you in a minute,</unknownNode><unknownNode>Robert   </unknownNode><unknownNode>Arms and the Man An extraordinary and damning judgement from the High Court today into the Serious Fraud Office's decision to abandon its investigation into BAE arms deals with Saudi Arabia. The judgement said, in part: "No one whether in this country or outside is entitled to interfere with the course of our justice." So why didn't the SFO - and the Blair government - just tell the Saudis to get lost? </unknownNode><unknownNode>You can watch Peter Marshall's reports into BAE here.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Brown Nine months into Gordon Brown's premiership - what more do we know about his vision for reforming the public services? And does it actually differ all that much from that of his predecessor?  David Grossman has been investigating - and we'll be reconvening our political panel to reflect on the week in politics.    Italy For those of us who love the country, Italy is an enigma. Simultaneously the most cultured, civilised and wonderful country in Western Europe - and a kind of hopeless Third World style mess of corruption and political incompetence. Are Italians once again searching for a Strong Man to run their country? Is Silvio Berlusconi on his way back to power?</unknownNode><unknownNode>You can watch the Newsnight report on corruption in Italian politics here.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Anyone who regularly reads the Newsnight blog will know that we have suffered from a series of technical problems for some time now. Comments disappear, the dreaded 502 'not available' message appears, and multiple copies of comments get submitted in error. (More on the problems here.)</unknownNode><unknownNode>Well, to much relief (not least here at Newsnight), a solution is about to be unveiled.</unknownNode><unknownNode>In the very near future the comments system that causes all the problems is being replaced by a BBC-wide system. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Under the new system, anyone wishing to leave a comment will need to sign in - a relatively swift and painless affair that comes with the added bonus of enabling you to leave your thoughts on blogs and message boards across all BBC websites.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Finally, we hope to revamp and relaunch the whole Newsnight blog shortly, with more bloggers, more variety, and the odd bit of video thrown in. But one step at a time...</unknownNode><unknownNode>We'll update you on the changes next week.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Liz Gibbons is today's programme producer. Here's her early email to the team ahead of the morning editorial meeting.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Hello all.</unknownNode><unknownNode>China and the torch feels like the biggest story in town - how do we do it though?</unknownNode><unknownNode>The BAE ruling has just come in - bids on this?</unknownNode><unknownNode>We should watch interest rates and Birmingham City obviously.</unknownNode><unknownNode>What else do you fancy?</unknownNode><unknownNode>David Grossman is working up a piece about Gordon Brown's vision for public services and why we're not at all clear what it is yet.  We could discuss off the back?</unknownNode><unknownNode>And we have a film about the Italian elections from Christian Fraser - the country is in such an economic mess that Berlusconi might get back in. </unknownNode><unknownNode>See you at 10.30 for some Apprentice-style team bonding. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Liz </unknownNode><unknownNode>ECONOMY</unknownNode><unknownNode>The men and women of the Monetary Policy Committee are back in the spotlight today as they begin their deliberations on whether to further cut interest rates. Their decision will be announced tomorrow but will it make any difference ? Are UK interest rates an effective instrument in a globalised economy and what can the government actually do to soften the impact of an economic downturn ? Newsnight reconvenes its own MPC tonight. </unknownNode><unknownNode>US ELECTIONS</unknownNode><unknownNode>What is Hillary's plan now? It's certainly not looking good as, with the loss of three key members of her campaign team, those 'misspeaks' and a Pennsylvania poll win looking increasingly uncertain, she holds out for a little help from her super delegate friends. But can they really save her? </unknownNode><unknownNode>JODRELL BANK</unknownNode><unknownNode>The biggest funding crisis for decades has hit the world of astronomy. Although the latest Science budget overall was up, you don't have to have a microscope to it to see there is less money for fundamental physics and astronomy - the exact subjects credited with pulling young people into science. Some fear that the future of one of Britain's greatest assets, Jodrell Bank's Lovell telescope, is now at risk. Susan Watts reports on why the government has upset the astonomy community so much and asks if this signals the end of blue skies thinking. Read Susan's feature here.   </unknownNode><unknownNode>Carol Rubra is today's programme producer - here's her early email to the team.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Good morning,</unknownNode><unknownNode>The economy seems to be the biggest story of the day so far - let's talk about what we should focus on. IMF has put the cost of the banking crisis at $1000 billion and downgraded growth predictions for the UK economy, plus continuing pressure on mortgages and housing, and rising inflation. Is it time to hear from our Shadow MPC?</unknownNode><unknownNode>We have a film from Susan Watts on how changes to science funding has led to hears that the future of Jodrell Bank is under threat and that the move away from funding pure science will mean young people are less inspired to pursue scientific careers.</unknownNode><unknownNode>And space for your own ideas - what are you interested in, what would make news? Hillary's campaign, government waste, RyanAir's adverts, Olympic torch?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Carol</unknownNode><unknownNode>Newsnight is holding the first live televised debate between the leading London mayoral contenders.   The race is incredibly tight, with each candidate accusing the others of negative campaigning and even dirty tricks.   With the characters involved we expect a colourful - even stormy - encounter.

That was five years ago and it may have been exaggeration but, as the ongoing trial of Chen Liangyu shows - or would show if it were not being held in secret - corruption went to the top of the tree under former president Jiang Zemin.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Chen was the party secretary in Shanghai, a member of the CPC Politbureau and at the centre of a grouping known as the Shanghai clique. He was disgraced in September 2006 and went on trial on 25 March 2008 in TIanjin, accused of diverting 25 billion RMB into the pockets of himself and associates in the Shanghai Communist Party elite. Yesterday another key figure in the scandal, Zhang Rongkun, was sentenced to 19 years in prison. Zhang's case is worth lookiing at because it illustrates the proven extent of the network of bribery and corruption discovered in Shanghai's business elite - not in the bad old early 90s but as late as two years ago.</unknownNode><unknownNode>According to China Daily Zhang: a) embezzled money from the part-privatised company Shanghai Electric b) paid out 29 billion RMB in bribes c) illegally issued bonds in his own companies and d) manipulated the stock price of Haixin Group. One sentence stands out from the webpage on the state news agency's report on Zhang's sentencing.

So has the inquest been worth the money? We'll have reaction to the verdict tonight and the results of a Newsnight poll on people's attitudes to the inquest.  Download the pdf of the full results here.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Ten pence tax Some thought that Gordon Brown's decision to scrap the 10 pence tax band in his last budget as Chancellor in favour of a cut in the basic rate was a political masterstroke at the time. Not any more. </unknownNode><unknownNode>The Treasury Select Committee and many of his own backbenchers have criticised the decision - which has come in to force this month - on the basis that it will leave the poorest people worst off.  The Prime Minister used to talk with missionary zeal about tackling poverty - do Labour's heartland voters still believe him? And does it play into wider anxieties amongst Labour MPs about the PM's vision?  </unknownNode><unknownNode>Olympic torch  The progress of the Olympic torch through Paris was stopped altogether today after the flame was doused twice by protestors. Can we expect such protests everywhere the torch goes, from now on? </unknownNode><unknownNode>Meanwhile, questions have been asked about the role of the Chinese security officials who surrounded the torch on its passage through London and Paris. Some London protestors - and even one torch bearer - allege they were heavy-handed. Who exactly are they - and what rights do they have on British soil? </unknownNode><unknownNode>Climate change  Nasa's top climate scientist said today that the world has already reached dangerous levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The former Chancellor - Lord Lawson, doesn't think so. In his new book, he claims that we've all been duped into taking climate change too seriously. He'll debate the point with the head of the Science Museum. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Liz Gibbons is today's programme producer - here's her early email to the team.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Hello</unknownNode><unknownNode>What would you like to cover today - and how would you like to cover it? </unknownNode><unknownNode> Treasury select committee report on 10p tax rate? Chinese torch protests - how can we move this on? Zimbabwe - is there a key interview we can push for? Any other big bids/off agenda stories you've spotted?</unknownNode><unknownNode>We have a film from Liz Mackean about food waste.  And we have an interview with Nigel Lawson about his new book which questions whether climate change is all that much of a problem.</unknownNode><unknownNode>And the Diana inquest might end.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Liz </unknownNode><unknownNode>Twenty-five &ldquo;torch relay offenders&rdquo; were arrested, China&rsquo;s official news agency Xinhua reported tersely just now. They showed  a photo of Gordon Brown with the torch and interviewed a man called &ldquo;Nick&rdquo; who bemoaned the politicisation of the games. Nowhere did Xinhua explain what the issue behind the protest was.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>My colleagues on BBC Sport, meanwhile, had to turn the special programme on the Olympic Flame relay into something resembling an highlights video of the Met Police rugby team blitz defence. The attempt to take the flame from Konnie Huq is currently the most watched video on the BBC website, closely followed by the attempt to douse it with a fire extinguisher. As Dame Kelly Holmes ran into the Dome flanked by police, more police, and Chinese men in blue uniforms whose jurisdiction on British soil in not, even now, clear to me, the &ldquo;friendly Olympics&rdquo; looked about as friendly as the Poll Tax riot.</unknownNode><unknownNode>It&rsquo;s been a major publicity coup for the protesters and a PR disaster for the British government.

The prosecution alleges that any passengers on the airlines concerned would have been "entirely at the mercy of the suicide bombers who happened to be on board with their explosive devices&rdquo;. The judge has said it will be a long, high profile trial with dozens of witnesses and it's expected it will last eight months. All of the men deny conspiracy to murder. Richard Watson will have the story.</unknownNode><unknownNode>ZIMBABWE Robert Mugabe is still clinging on to power in Zimbabwe so is there going to be a Presidential run off? President Mugabe has finally re-appeared after the Presidential and Parliamentary elections, shown on state TV meeting African Union leaders.  One of his spokesmen, Deputy Information Minister Bright Matonga, said that if the result from last Saturday's Presidential vote showed a second round was necessary Mr Mugabe would stand. Official results from the Presidential poll are due out tomorrow but the Opposition insists it has won the vote. But what is life like for ordinary people inside the country just now? We have a film secretly shot inside Zimbabwe which gives a fascinating insight into what people there think is going on.</unknownNode><unknownNode>ISRAEL More conflict - this time in Israel. We have had unique access to one day's events in one of the illegal settlements in the northern West Bank. Here Tim Franks, for Newsnight, has witnessed Israel's ineffectual attempts to remove settlers. The Israeli Army forcibly evicts the inhabitants of the small outpost at the start of the day, but this triggers further conflict, between the army, left wing Israeli groups trying to reclaim the land for the Palestinian owner and the settlers who are trying to get back into their homes. </unknownNode><unknownNode>TONY BLAIR What does Tony Blair think about God, religion and globalisation? The new convert to Roman Catholicism is giving a speech tonight as part of the Cardinal's lecture series in which he will be speaking about faith and globalisation.

I hope you join us, Kirsty </unknownNode><unknownNode>Last weekend the Chinese state mysteriously lifted its block on the BBC's English language website. I don't know how long it will last for, or why they did it. What we do know is a lot of Chinese readers were critical about the BBC's coverage of China they found there, which they believed had "departed from the truth". Having done my fair share of that coverage, including getting myself followed by secret police for interviewing a man purged from the party 50 years ago, I decided to take a look at the BBC website.</unknownNode><unknownNode>If you want to watch video reports on China, just click here for a list, sorted by date. If you ignore the odd colourful story about training English chefs to cook Chinese food, it's fair to say the "metanarrative" of most of our coverage focuses on the challenges of economic growth and the repressive nature of the Chinese regime. I've often heard foreign journalists say that there is only one story in China "and that's China". Everyone who's tried to report there knows what that means.</unknownNode><unknownNode>I think now there is a real challenge: for the first time I can be sure that my reporting on China will be seen or read in China, and not just by CCP officials with access to diplomatic-compound satellite dishes. So I have decided to re-start blogging here regularly, between now and the Olympics, to try and engage any English-speaking Chinese readers on a wider range of stories. I'm offering them a genuine chance to do what readers here do: influence and comment on our coverage.

We'll have the latest tonight.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Bertie bows out  He was known as the "Teflon Taoiseach" - because of his ability to dodge mud-slinging and allegations of sleaze, but the Irish Premier Bertie Ahern announced today that he's stepping down after 11 years. His predecessor in the role once called him: "The most skilful, the most devious, the most cunning of them all." He's been dogged by allegations of financial irregularities over the years - but will also be remembered for playing a key role in the Northern Ireland peace process. We'll look back at his career highs and lows.</unknownNode><unknownNode>"Brain Gym" You might not have heard of it, but your children could well be experts. Brain Gym is a programme used in hundreds of schools across Britain - backed by the government. It&rsquo;s a series of daily physical exercises that are supposed to aid learning - by stimulating the vital organs. Many teachers - and many pupils - are convinced it works. But scientists are worried - believing that it amounts to "pseudo-science" and is misleading young children about the workings of the human body. The American founder of Brain Gym will be on the programme. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Ben Elton Yesterday it was Kevin Spacey... today it's Ben Elton's turn to attack the BBC.

Unnamed sources say talks have been taking place with representatives from the opposition MDC and President Mugabe's party, chaired by the South African president, Thabo Mbeki.

Incumbent Robert Mugabe, who's been in power for 28 years, is seeking another term as president. The Local, Senate, Assembly and Presidential polls come against the backdrop of a disintegrating economy - the annual rate of inflation exceeded 100,000% in February. Opposition activists have complained of intimidation, unequal media coverage and other anomalies. The opposition itself is divided and has failed to unite behind a single figure. Former Finance Minister Simba Makoni is challenging Mr Mugabe as an independent and could split the vote of the ruling Zanu-PF party.  With only a day to go there are still major questions and arguments of voter registration and the number of ballot papers printed - one report suggest that an extra three million ballot papers have been printed. The BBC as you may know is banned from Zimbabwe. Only a handful of international journalists were granted accreditation, one of those was RTE's Richard Downes - but he was only given official access to the country for three days around polling day. Undeterred by such bureaucratic irritations he slipped into Zimbabwe as a tourist to try to assess the state of the country in the run up to the election. See his exclusive report on the programme tonight. We'll be speaking to Simba Makoni who is challenging Robert Mugabe for the presidency.   IRAQ Scores of people have been killed in fighting between the Mahdi Army, Iraqi, and in many instances, US troops during a crackdown on the militia of firebrand cleric Moqtada al-Sadr. Why is this happening now and is Iraq on the verge of a civil war? We'll be speaking to a senior adviser to the Iraqi army.</unknownNode><unknownNode>TERMINAL FIVE More than 30 flights have been cancelled at Heathrow's new Terminal Five  because of problems with its high-tech baggage handling system.  Thousands of passengers have been stuck at the airport awaiting flights and trying to trace their bags.</unknownNode><unknownNode>BIG BROTHER  George Orwell's world of Big Brother seems to be alive and well in supermarket chain Lidl. Detectives hired by Lidl, which has thousands of stores worldwide, including 450 in Britain - have been monitoring employees in Germany.  Several hundred pages of surveillance records have been passed on to Stern magazine, causing outrage among the unions and data protection officials. Peter Marshall is on the case. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Robert Morgan is today's programme producer - here's his early email.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Good morning everyone,</unknownNode><unknownNode>We have a strong undercover film from Zimbabwe on the eve of the presidential elections from Richard Downes and Ian O'Reilly. We also have an interview with presidential candidate Simba Makoni.  I'll tell you more in the meeting.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>It's been reported this morning that at least 44 people have been killed in clashes between Iraqi and US forces, and Shiite militiamen from the Mehdi Army. What exactly is happening on the ground in Basra and across the country? </unknownNode><unknownNode>Should we be looking at the MPs expenses story again today? Are there any other stories we should be doing like asylum story or the pregnant man. Do come to the meeting with your ideas.</unknownNode><unknownNode>See you in a minute,</unknownNode><unknownNode>Robert  </unknownNode><unknownNode> </unknownNode><unknownNode>ENTENTE AMICALE</unknownNode><unknownNode>In his first state visit to Britain, President Sarkozy has certainly turned on all his charm, praising British dynamism and wooing Eurosceptics with flattery over how Europe needs Britain. He says he hopes his state visit to Britain will mark a new era in Franco-British relations.  Gordon Brown has also hailed a new era of closer relations between France and the UK, but behind all the hyperbole, what does it all really mean? Michael Crick assesses what both men have to gain from this love-in.</unknownNode><unknownNode>And we'll be discussing what a Sarkozy - Brown alliance will mean with a former French minister, a writer and an academic.</unknownNode><unknownNode>THE WORKFORCE THAT CHANGED THE WORLD</unknownNode><unknownNode>Chinese workers have traditionally had few rights to speak out, but a country where strikes are illegal is now becoming the strike centre of the world.  In the first of two special films from China, Paul Mason reports on the new Chinese workforce - the 300 million people whose cheap labour provides the life force of the economy - and how some are beginning to fight for their employment rights and are being physically attacked in the process.</unknownNode><unknownNode>ASYLUM BATTLE</unknownNode><unknownNode>On the eve of elections in Zimbabwe, why has the British government suddenly decided it&rsquo;s safe to end its moratorium and send failed asylum seekers back to the country?  Robin Denselow has been investigating. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Carol Rubra is tonight's programme producer. Here's her early email to the team.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Good morning,</unknownNode><unknownNode>Tonight we have the first of Paul Mason's films from his recent trip to China and apart from that the programme is wide open so let's discuss what else we should put in it and how we should do the stories. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Carol</unknownNode><unknownNode>Tonight, MPs are debating the case for a full inquiry into the Iraq war. Newsnight is running an exclusive film which, some will say, provides compelling evidence that such an inquiry is absolutely necessary.</unknownNode><unknownNode>THE CASE OF "CURVEBALL"</unknownNode><unknownNode>In the late 1990s an Iraqi engineer turned up in Germany seeking asylum. Codenamed Curveball, he was questioned by German intelligence, and what he told them was shocking. He claimed he had witnessed a biological weapons programme in Iraq. </unknownNode><unknownNode>His information was passed on to the CIA, and it became a cornerstone of the intelligence case that Colin Powell made to the United Nations on the case for war. The only problem was, none of Curveball's claims were true. And, moreover, many of the holes in his story had been identified months before Colin Powell's presentation. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Curveball's been in hiding ever since the war, but a report for Spiegel magazine has tracked him down. Tonight Newsnight will show the first images of Curveball that have been seen since the war. Does he stand by his claims? And what does the whole saga tell us about the world of intelligence? We'll be talking to Colin Powell's former Chief of Staff. </unknownNode><unknownNode>We'll also be hearing from two MPs about whether a full inquiry is now necessary - and, if so, why it's taken so long.</unknownNode><unknownNode>TIME TO BOYCOTT?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Nicholas Sarkozy is the latest politician to suggest that he hasn't ruled out boycotting the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics in the light of the crackdown by Chinese authorities in Tibet. Why has the British government not been more outspoken about China's record? Are ministers hampered by the fact that Britain is hosting the 2012 Olympics? We'll debate this.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>Liz Gibbons is today's programme producer. Here is her early email to the team.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Hope you all had a Happy Easter. </unknownNode><unknownNode>So - today we have a film almost ready to run about an Iraqi defector known as Curveball. The evidence he gave his German handlers in the years before the Iraq war formed a key part of the intelligence case made by Colin Powell. He was the key source for the allegation that Iraq had several mobile chemical weapons labs. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Since the war his evidence has been discredited. And he's been called a fabricator. We've worked alongside Spiegel magazine and tracked him down in Germany &ndash; he now claims he never said that Iraq had WMD.  This leaves us with a whole host of questions about intelligence work and the Iraq war.   Otherwise - the programme is pretty wide open - and there are a lot of good stories around. So let's have a heated debate about what's around and what we can bring to the stories.</unknownNode><unknownNode>City limits?  The Bank of England is extending the support it gives to commercial banks. Heads of high street lenders have been meeting with the bank's governor to ask for guarantees of funds to help them through the credit crisis. They've also raised the issue of rogue traders spreading malicious rumours to cash-in on falling share prices.   Paul Mason is looking at whether the Bank of England has done enough. And he'll be examining how close we might be to collapse in the UK banking system. Emily is currently out and about in the City of London asking people there if it's time for greater regulation in the markets to avoid rogue trader activity. We'll also be bringing together a big hedge fund manager, a City lawyer and a regulator to discuss all these issues live. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Tibet  Thousands of soldiers were seen in Lhasa on Thursday amid reports of a huge military build-up as China admitted for the first time it had shot Tibetan protesters. State-controlled Xinhua news agency reported four people were shot and wounded last weekend by police in a Tibetan area of southwestern China, as the Dalai Lama expressed fears that the crackdown on unrest had caused many casualties. Long military convoys were on the move in Tibet while troops poured into nearby provinces after a week of violence directed against China's rule of the Himalayan region, witnesses, activist groups and media reports said.  A week of protests against China's 57-year rule of Tibet erupted into rioting in Lhasa last Friday. Demonstrations have since spilled over into nearby Chinese provinces with sizeable ethnic Tibetan populations. Peter Marshall will have the latest on this story and will be examining what the Dalai Lama wants from China.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Sarkozy's France Next week French President Nicolas Sarkozy makes a state visit to Britain with his new wife Carla Bruni.

During the live discussions we will look at the consequences of the conflict for Britain, trust in public life and US foreign policy. </unknownNode><unknownNode>We have a live interview with Tony Blair's former Chief of Staff Jonathan Powell. We plan a wider discussion as well. Which guests would you like on and what questions would you like asked?</unknownNode><unknownNode>We also have the final 10 Days To War drama, starring Kenneth Branagh as Colonel Tim Collins.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Iraq will dominate the programme, but what other suggestions have you got? We should clearly keep an eye on the National Security plan to be announced in the Commons, and the McCann story.   </unknownNode><unknownNode>See you in the meeting</unknownNode><unknownNode>Dan </unknownNode><unknownNode>Whilst my fellow political journalists all flocked to Ken Livingstone&rsquo;s campaign launch in London, I took the train to Slough for a far more interesting story, largely ignored by the Westminster pack, and which I therefore had almost to myself.</unknownNode><unknownNode>There was much jubilation in the Slough Labour Party after an election court disqualified a local Conservative councillor, Eshaq Khan, for corrupt and fraudulent election practices.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>Mr Khan was found to have secured his election last May by registering at various properties around his ward more than a hundred &ldquo;ghost&rdquo; voters &ndash; people who didn&rsquo;t exist or weren&rsquo;t entitled to be on the voting register - and who then, of course, voted for him.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>Criminal trial</unknownNode><unknownNode>Khan was also accused by the judge Richard Mawry of perverting the course of justice by getting several witnesses to commit what the judge called &ldquo;blatant&rdquo; and &ldquo;bare-faced perjury&rdquo; during the recent election court case to try and save his skin.    A criminal trial now looks likely.  Three men have already been arrested and police inquiries are continuing.</unknownNode><unknownNode>The judge also awarded costs against Khan. The Conservative Party won&rsquo;t say if they&rsquo;ve agreed to pay them - which strongly suggests to me that they have.  Lord Ashcroft may race a total bill of around &pound;500,000 for the party.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Richard Mawry&rsquo;s judgement may be great news for Labour in Slough, but it will be less welcome to Labour nationally.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>Mawry, you may recall, was the judge who presided over the Birmingham election fraud case in the spring of 2005, when he compared Birmingham to a banana republic and was scathing about this government&rsquo;s introduction of postal voting on demand.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>'Disastrous experiment'</unknownNode><unknownNode>After that notorious case ministers tried to tighten the rules on postal votes, but Mawry claimed today that these changes had made little difference and that voting fraud was an easy as ever.  Indeed, if anything, Mawry&rsquo;s judgement today was more scathing of government policy than it was in Birmingham three years ago.</unknownNode><unknownNode>The problem, he said, was not just the &ldquo;disastrous experiment of postal voting on demand&rdquo;, but the extremely lax system of electoral registration in this country. </unknownNode><unknownNode>&ldquo;Great Britain&rsquo;s system of voter registration may well have been a quaint but harmless anomaly while personal voting was the norm but the introduction of postal voting on demand has made it lethal to the democratic process.&rdquo;  Roll-stuffing, as the Australians call it, &ldquo;is childishly simple to commit,&rdquo; said Mawry, &ldquo;and very difficult to detect.</unknownNode><unknownNode>'Decent choice'</unknownNode><unknownNode>To ignore the possibility that it is widespread, particularly in local elections, is a policy that an ostrich would despise.&rdquo;</unknownNode><unknownNode>Above all, he criticised the belief by many Labour people that making it easier for people to vote, though postal ballots, would boost voting turn-out.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>What really boost turn-out, he argued, was giving voters a decent choice.  He pointed to the 85% turnout in last year&rsquo;s French presidential election (where there&rsquo;s no easy postal voting) as a good example of this and concluded: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not how you vote that brings out the voters.  It&rsquo;s the choices you are given.&rdquo;          </unknownNode><unknownNode>In speaking out so boldly, Richard Mawry is surely becoming something of a pain in the neck for this government, rather like Elizabeth Filkin and Sir Alistair Graham. </unknownNode><unknownNode>But he should be careful.  They both lost their jobs. </unknownNode><unknownNode>ECONOMY The US Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson has admitted the American economy is facing a "sharp decline" and economists are forecasting the fifth US interest rate cut today since the credit crunch began. US house prices have fallen for the first time since the 1930s; can we now avoid another Great Depression? Hugh Pym has been investigating how central bankers are trying to learn the lessons of history.</unknownNode><unknownNode> VOTES Is the British electoral system fit for purpose?  A Conservative politician has been thrown out of office and had his election overturned for using scores of bogus postal votes in last year's local elections in Slough. The judge said the combination of postal voting on demand and the ease of registering voters had made fraud of this type "childishly easy" to commit, despite recent legislation designed to enhance its security.  So are the government's attempts to make it easier to vote part of the problem? Michael Crick has the details.</unknownNode><unknownNode>10 DAYS TO WAR On the fifth anniversary of the parliamentary vote over going to war in Iraq we'll be talking to two back bench Labour MPs, one who supported the government position and one who opposed it. They'll be telling us about the difficulties they experienced in making their decisions. </unknownNode><unknownNode>ANTHONY MINGHELLA And we'll be looking back at the life and work of British film director, Anthony Minghella, who died suddenly this morning. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Carol Rubra is tonight's programme producer. Here's her early email to the team.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Good morning,</unknownNode><unknownNode>Let's talk about what we should do on the economy and how we can make it look and feel fresh and different. I've been talking to Hugh Pym about looking at historical comparisons with the Great Depression.

In New York the Dow Jones Industrials tumbled 194 points, more than 1.5%, in early trading before recovering.  London's FTSE 100 index was down 2.7%. The Bank of England today made an extra &pound;5bn available for UK banks to borrow to ease credit fears. The money was five times over-subscribed.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Meanwhile, on the markets, US, UK and European banks were hammered; Lehman Brothers fell 30%, UBS lost 13%, HBOS 10% and Commerzbank fell 7.9%. Investors are worried that the collapse of Bear Stearns, one of Wall Street's biggest names, is a sign that the credit crunch is getting worse and lending might seize up. </unknownNode><unknownNode>The BBC's Economic Correspondent Hugh Pym will assess how big the problem is and what the potential market solutions are. We'll also be looking at the impact on the UK economy. And Stephanie Flanders will join us live from New York to give us the latest on the fallout in the US.</unknownNode><unknownNode>We'll also be reconvening Newsnight's Shadow Monetary Policy Committee to cast their expert eyes over events.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Markets slump on banking worries</unknownNode><unknownNode>Tibet</unknownNode><unknownNode>The deadline for Tibetan protesters to surrender to the police has passed, after a quiet day in the city of Lhasa. China had given demonstrators in the city until midnight to give themselves up or face punishment. Exiled Tibetans said security forces had been rounding up political dissidents and witnesses said there was a heavy police presence on the streets. Dozens are feared dead after days of rioting in Lhasa, with each side accusing the other of excessive force. Other parts of China also saw rallies on the weekend, while Tibetans in Nepal and India are continuing to protest. Mark Urban will analyse what's been happening and examines whether the Chinese Government will crack down hard on protestors just months before the Olympics.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Tibet protester deadline passes</unknownNode><unknownNode>Iraq: 10 Days to War</unknownNode><unknownNode>Five years on from the war in Iraq we speak to former Cabinet Secretary, Lord Butler about the use of intelligence on WMD.</unknownNode><unknownNode>And from the web team</unknownNode><unknownNode>The countdown continues with 3 Days to War.  In You Are Welcome Here, with UN diplomacy dead, the weapons inspectors continue their fruitless search in Iraq.  Watch a preview of tonight&rsquo;s episode here.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Our Diplomatic Editor Mark Urban has written up his recollections of reporting on the preparations for war back in 2003, and shares his thoughts on how &ndash; with hindsight &ndash; he might have reported things differently.</unknownNode><unknownNode>And Michael Crick has added to the Big Fat Politics Blog with a few words about how Shadow Education Secretary Michael Gove has been &ldquo;cracking the whip&rdquo; with the leader of the Tory party; plus some thoughts about the many novelists Parliament and British politics have produced over the years&hellip;</unknownNode><unknownNode>bbc.co.uk/newsnight </unknownNode><unknownNode>I&rsquo;ve just finished a thriller written by the only remaining member of the government to have published a novel (at least by my reckoning).  The novelist in question is Michael Wills, a Minister of State at the Justice Department, who, for some strange reason, writes under the name of David McKeowen (especially odd when he then identifies himself as Michael Wills on page one).</unknownNode><unknownNode>Wills&rsquo;s first novel Grip is not about politics in any way, but a thriller about what happens to a middle class family when their son suddenly finds himself owing &pound;30,000 to a violent drug dealer.  It doesn&rsquo;t pretend to be great literature, but is certainly an excellent read, examining the psychologies of each of the different players.  It would make a great film or TV drama.  He has also published a second thriller, Trapped, and more books are on the way.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>Michael Wills, a distinctly Brownite member of the government, claims to have had six careers in his adult lifetime.  Looking at his Who&rsquo;s Who entry these seem to be: diplomat, TV producer, businessman (as founder of the independent TV company Juniper), MP, minister, and now novelist.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Parliament and British politics boasts a surprising number of novelists over the years &ndash; from Disraeli and John Buchan to Jeffrey Archer and Iain Duncan Smith &ndash; and Winston Churchill even published a novel early on in his career.  Other novelists to have held ministerial office since Labour came to power are Helen Liddell, Chris Mullin and Peter Hain.    My complete list of British politician novelists runs to 41 names, as follows, but I&rsquo;d love to know of any that I&rsquo;ve missed: 	 Rupert Allason (MP) Jeffrey Archer (MP) Joe Ashton (MP) Stuart Bell (MP) Melvyn Bragg (peer) John Buchan	 (MP) Winston Churchill (MP) Philip Collins (adviser) Julian Critchley (MP) Edwina Currie (MP) Bertie Denham (peer) Benjamin Disraeli (MP) Michael Dobbs (adviser)	 Iain Duncan Smith (MP) Walter Feinburgh (MP) Maurice Edelman (MP) Peter Hain (MP) David Hart (adviser) Roy Hattersley (MP) Douglas Hurd (MP) PD James (peer) Boris Johnson (MP) Stanley Johnson (MEP) Robert Kilroy Silk (MP) Helen Liddell (MP) Bob Marshall-Andrews (MP) Chris Mullin (MP) Amanda Platell (adviser) Lance Price (adviser) Barbara Rendell (peer) Tim Renton (MP) Brian Sedgemore (MP) Martin Sixsmith (adviser) CP Snow (minister/peer) John Stonehouse (MP) Michael Spicer (MP) David Walder (MP) Ann Widdecombe (MP) Michael Wills (MP (as David McKeowen))</unknownNode><unknownNode>CURRENTLY WRITING:</unknownNode><unknownNode>Chris Bryant (MP) Alastair Campbell (adviser)  </unknownNode><unknownNode>BBC colleagues who accidentally overheard David Cameron last Friday evening, while rehearsing his speech to the Conservatives&rsquo; (so-called) Spring Forum in Gateshead, were struck by the important role which the Shadow Education Secretary &ndash; and regular Newsnight Review panellist &ndash; Michael Gove played in the proceedings.</unknownNode><unknownNode>&ldquo;He was really cracking the whip,&rdquo; I&rsquo;m told, in advising Cameron very forcefully on using softer language.  Gove advised him, for instance, to refer to &ldquo;mothers and fathers&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;parents&rdquo;, and how it was best to avoid an old-fashioned phrase like &ldquo;creeds and colours&rdquo;.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Michael Gove has long been identified as a rising star on the Conservative front bench, a moderniser and close ally of Cameron, but my colleagues were surprised at how much the Tory leader was happy to defer to his education spokesman.  Until now it had been thought that Steve Hilton was Cameron&rsquo;s chief modernisation guru.  Although Hilton was among those listening to David Cameron's rehearsal, he said very little in comparison with Gove. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Quote for the day: "Hell is separation from God.

In tonight's programme:</unknownNode><unknownNode>America's Northern Rock? US bank Bear Stearns has had to seek emergency funding backed by the US Federal Reserve. So is one of Wall Street's biggest names on the verge of collapse and what are the risks of contagion? George Bush admits things look bad for the American economy but says he is confident it will weather the storm. Really?</unknownNode><unknownNode>The Tories We'll hear from the Shadow Chancellor George Osborne  - we'll ask him to explain why the Tories aren't doing better given the poor state of the economy. Is it really wise to back the Government's spending plans and what ever happened to the promise of tax cuts?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Shannon Matthews We'll have the latest on the extraordinary discovery of missing nine-year-old Shannon Matthews.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Tibet The worst rioting in Tibet for twenty years - is this the shape of things to come as the countdown to the Beijing Olympics begins?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Newsnight is at 11pm tonight on BBC 2.  Gavin </unknownNode><unknownNode>This is the season of the spring conferences (although they all take place in winter), but this year all three major parties have been rather unfortunate in the locations they've chosen. </unknownNode><unknownNode>First Labour went to Birmingham where the party has been accused of massive fraud in postal ballots. Then last week the Liberal Democrats went to Liverpool where they run the city council - unfortunately for them, that council was recently declared by the Audit Commission to be one of the three worst financially managed local authorities in England. </unknownNode><unknownNode>And today, the Conservatives are holding their conference in Gateshead, where the party hasn't had an elected councillor since 1996. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Worse still, one of the last Conservative councillors in Gateshead was a gentleman by the name of Derek Conway - the Conservative MP disgraced over his misuse of parliamentary staffing allowances to employ members of his family.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Dan Kelly is today's programme producer - here's his early email.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Good Morning.</unknownNode><unknownNode>We have some strong stories today.</unknownNode><unknownNode>This morning there are reports of gunfire and rioting in Tibet, what is going on? </unknownNode><unknownNode>Michael Crick is at the Tory conference - in the light of recent Government problems why are they not doing better? Given the concerns of Middle England about rises in the cost of living and higher taxes on cars, drink and income, many in the party believe they should concentrate more on policies which could ease the financial burden on the suburbs. </unknownNode><unknownNode>An interesting EU climate change report which says that global warming could lead to mass immigration into Europe - could this make voters care more about the environment? </unknownNode><unknownNode>Let's watch the dollar too.

On Newsnight we speak to Britain's man at the UN who was applying the thumbscrews on behalf of Tony Blair - Sir Jeremy Greenstock - and one of those he tried to persuade Ambassador Valdes from Chile. Just how nasty did things get?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Economy But we begin tonight with the global economy. Today we saw new highs for gold and oil and a new low for the dollar. As Stephanie Flanders explains it could be a real pivotal moment. We'll debate whether the world's central banks can or should do anything to address the continuing turbulence in the markets.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Iran Finally tomorrow sees parliamentary elections in Iran. Will the result give more power to the Military or the Mullahs? Jon Leyne gives us his assessment.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Don't forget to tune in for a dramatic performance from Tom Conti in 10 Days to War and then join us at Newsnight straight afterwards.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Simon </unknownNode><unknownNode>It was only a few days ago that I observed here that, remarkably, we now had six independent MPs.  And now we have a seventh with the resignation from the Conservative whip (or sacking, depending on how you tell the story) of the MP for Castle Point, Bob Spink.</unknownNode><unknownNode>The word among Tory MPs is that Mr Spink will soon join UKIP, and certainly he has very similar views on Europe and other matters. But last night Mr Spink told me that he is a Tory and will continue to sit on the Conservative benches even if he is no longer taking their whip.  UKIP will no doubt do their best to lure him in, as it would be quite a coup to secure their first Westminster MP, though they already have several lords and MEPs.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Mr Spink's departure means that David Cameron has now lost four MPs in the last few months - Quentin Davies, who defected to Labour, along with Andrew Pelling, Derek Conway and Bob Spink who have all left amid a variety of personal problems. Conservatives will no doubt argue that they are glad to get rid of most, if not all, of these people, but it doesn't look very good.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Surely a party aspiring to be our next government should be gaining MPs, not shedding them?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Hello All,</unknownNode><unknownNode>Amazing acting from Tom Conti as the Mexican Ambassador in tonight's drama from 10 Days to War. It reveals the tough tactics used at the UN in order to get backing or block the war in Iraq. And it also highlights the bugging of the Ambassadors that went on. All points we'll put to Jeremy Greenstock - our Ambassador at the time - and Juan Gabriel Valdes who was the Chilean Ambassador. It'll be interesting to see whether they can agree now - having not agreed at the time.</unknownNode><unknownNode>What else should we do today? </unknownNode><unknownNode>Is there any more fall out from the budget that we should do?</unknownNode><unknownNode>What about the Carlyle group's mortgage fund? It is going bust. And it might be the first of a few. Stephanie has agreed to explain.</unknownNode><unknownNode>We've also got a film from Iran ahead of their elections tomorrow AND a film from the School Swap in Bradford - Bradford Utd.  There are other interesting tales around - - The Inquest opens into the death of Michael Todd. What led to death of one of Britain's top policemen?  - Why have the Conservative council in Ealing withdrawn funding for the famous campaign group Southall Black Sisters? Isn't David Cameron a supporter of such things? - Are the Jackson Five really moving to Devon?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Simon</unknownNode><unknownNode>From 10 to 19 March before Newsnight each night BBC Two is showing a series of mini-films dramatising the build up to the start of the Iraq war.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Editor Peter Barron explained why Newsnight has supported these dramas on his blog. The lead up to war in Iraq is one of the most requested stories Newsnight receives and we've covered it extensively over the last five years. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Through drama we get an opportunity to focus on stories that otherwise we could do not either because cameras were not present or key people in the events do not want to be appear directly. Drama is also a way to reach an audience that would not normally watch the documentaries or news programmes. </unknownNode><unknownNode>We're keen to hear what you think of 10 Days to War. The purpose to the stories is to explore how we went to war, not why.  Have you found them gripping? Have you discovered something new? Have you wanted to find out more or watch them again online? Can you not wait for the next one? Or perhaps you've hated them. Tell us here.  We want to know what you think of the dramas, please - not the decision to go to war.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Credibility Crunch Much has been made of the warning that Alistair Darling was not going to incite a quickening of the pulse with today's budget. The chancellor was probably delighted. The more we called him &ldquo;grey&rdquo;, &ldquo;dull&rdquo; and &ldquo;flat&rdquo;, the easier his job became - like a football manager downplaying his team's chances before a cup final. </unknownNode><unknownNode>In the end, he didn&rsquo;t need to blind us with brilliance. He just sought to reassure us that things weren't about to go really badly wrong. Although he downgraded economic growth forecasts, they still seem pretty optimistic. Although he upped borrowing to &pound;43bn - sailing perilously close to his own rules on debt - he still seemed to tell us all would shortly be well in the economy. </unknownNode><unknownNode>How so? Can he confidently predict the country won't see a recession? Or is he just shutting his eyes and hoping the problem will go away? David Cameron has accused the government of a 'credibility crunch'. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Tonight, after we've &ldquo;toothcombed&rdquo; the red book to see what all the detail really amounts to, we'll be talking to the three main parties to ask if the chancellor has emerged today with his credibility in tact, or if this budget is merely storing up trouble for a later date. </unknownNode><unknownNode>More on the budget from BBC News.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Ten Days to War Our film tonight revisits the argument over post-war planning in Iraq. Clare Short, the International Development Secretary of the time, is one of the characters in the film. She will then appear in the studio alongside Major General Tim Cross - played by Stephen Rea in the drama - whose task was to re-build Iraq after the war. We'll be asking where the planning went wrong. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Watch the first two episodes and read more about the series on the website.</unknownNode><unknownNode>A few weeks ago Newsnight approached the film director Ken Loach for an interview for one of my films about the split inside George Galloway's Respect party - Loach himself is a keen Galloway supporter.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>But Loach was reluctant to be interviewed by me, described me to my producer as "The Oscar Wilde of Television Centre" - quite complimentary in some ways, though friends find it hard to see what Loach was getting at.</unknownNode><unknownNode>In response, my daughter Catherine couldn't resist drawing this cartoon...</unknownNode><unknownNode>Robert Morgan is tonight's programme producer. Here's his early email to the team.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Good morning everyone,</unknownNode><unknownNode>Budget It's Alistair Darling's first Budget day. Can he rescue his reputation after the bad reception he received for his pre-budget report and Northern Rock? The BBC's learned that an increase in tax on fuel won't be imposed next month. The Chancellor had been planning to confirm the two pence rise when he delivers his first budget at lunchtime, but has now shelved the idea for six months because of the rising price of crude oil.  Will he go for green taxes and higher duties on alcohol? How will he help reduce child poverty, as Gordon Brown has promised? What will be the effect of the credit crunch and the recent nationalisation of Northern Rock on government spending?</unknownNode><unknownNode>The Budget is at 12.30pm (full details here). Ideas on how to do the story are welcome.</unknownNode><unknownNode>10 Days to War We have a disco set up between Clare Short and Major General Tim Cross following tonight's really strong film on problems with post-war planning in Iraq.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Robert </unknownNode><unknownNode>School Admissions</unknownNode><unknownNode>A "shocking" number of state schools are breaking new admissions rules designed to make the system fairer. According to a government investigation some asked for financial contributions from parents as a condition of entry, others tried to find out the occupation of parents. So was this due to an ignorance of the rules or a deliberate attempt to circumvent them? And where does this leave the Labour government's promise to improve social mobility?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Labour and the Rich</unknownNode><unknownNode>On the eve of the budget David Grossman investigates Labour's attitude to the very rich. Last month they were targeting the wealth of the so-called 'non-doms' but tonight Business Secretary John Hutton will say that instead of worrying about huge salaries we should celebrate success. What's going on and what does it signal about tomorrow's budget?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Credit Crunch</unknownNode><unknownNode>Economics Editor Stephanie Flanders will look at today's decision by central bankers to pump hundreds of billions of dollars into the overall financial system to try to ease the credit crunch.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Gaza</unknownNode><unknownNode>Our Diplomatic Editor Mark Urban has a powerful film from both sides of the Gaza border. How have the lives of Israelis and Palestinians been affected by the conflict in the region and what are the chances of an agreement that will bring a lasting peace?</unknownNode><unknownNode>And don't forget to tune in at 10.30 to catch the second episode of the 10 Days to War series.</unknownNode><unknownNode>It's now 9 days to the invasion of Iraq and a group of senior Iraqi exiles are meeting to discuss their plans to form a post-Saddam government. But will the Americans back them?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Then later in the programme we'll talk to one of the central characters of the film, Francis Brooke who advised one of the key Iraqi exiles.</unknownNode><unknownNode>That's 9 Days to War plus Newsnight from 10.30 tonight.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Dan Kelly is today's programme producer - here is his early email to the team.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Good morning all,</unknownNode><unknownNode>We have some good options today. Ahead of the budget, David Grossman has been examining party policy towards the very rich, and examines whether the public&rsquo;s attitude towards tax and the very wealthy may have changed. Who should we do off the back? </unknownNode><unknownNode>Later today the Home Affairs Select Committee will reveal new figures about the number of young people missing from school rolls across the country - could this be evidence of a higher than expected number of forced marriages in Britain? There is also a separate and perhaps more rigorous study in Luton on this subject. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Mark Urban has a film from inside Gaza and we have an interview on the back of the 10 days to war drama with Francis Brooke.</unknownNode><unknownNode>What else? Citizenship classes will probably feel too old by tonight, but what do you think?   </unknownNode><unknownNode>Dan    </unknownNode><unknownNode>I earlier reported the shock news that Madame Tussauds had no plans for a Gordon Brown waxwork. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Well, Number 10 insist that Mr Brown was invited to sit for a Tussauds waxwork as recently as March 3rd. Apparently the Brown team was contacted by Madame Tussauds' global head of external relations, Nicky Hobbs who writes, "I am honoured to tell you that The Prime Minister, Mr Gordon Brown, has been selected to be honoured by the Tussauds team and be amongst the very select group of people that are made into wax figures.</unknownNode><unknownNode>"We choose our figures from detailed public surveys, and he has been a hugely popular choice amongst local Londoners and tourists from around the world. </unknownNode><unknownNode>"On behalf of our creative team I would like to ask for a sitting to obtain detailed measurements, a sitting takes up to two hours. I would send a team to a location of Mr Brown's choice and to suit his schedule if he is happy to sit. We realise Mr Brown is of course incredibly busy, and we would hope to agree on a sitting date that falls within the next six months."</unknownNode><unknownNode>Curious. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Tonight Jeremy Paxman and Newsnight will appear a little later - after the first in the series 10 Days to War. The opening episode is a dramatic representation of senior Foreign Office Lawyer, Elizabeth Wilmhurst's decision to resign over the legality of military action. </unknownNode><unknownNode>On Newsnight we'll debate whether the war in Iraq was legal - and if it was not legal, whether that matters. We'll be joined by General Sir Mike Jackson one of those charged with running the war five years ago, William Taft, who was at the time the legal advisor to the US State Department and leading QC Philippe Sands who doubts the legality of the war.</unknownNode><unknownNode>With just two days to go before the Budget we're already being told to expect many "green" measures. But does it really achieve anything other than increasing government revenue to put up taxes on so called environmentally bad things? Our science editor Susan Watts asks whether a few green taxes will really change anyone's behaviour. We'll then debate whether such taxes can be justified. And our economics editor Stephanie Flanders has a profile of the man with the job of making these decisions, Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Finally, have you read the blog of Whitehall insider Civil Serf? It's believed to be the online outpourings of a disillusioned civil servant. At the weekend it disappeared from the web. So what happened? We've asked Michael Crick to find out.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Do tune in to BBC 2 at 10.30pm for Ten Days to War and then join us immediately afterwards.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Sounds like a good headline for the PM? - well not really.  It seems that the people at Madame Tussauds don't think Mr Brown is enough of a draw to bother making a waxwork of him.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Public relations manager Ben Lovett tells PA news:  "At the moment we have no plans to make Gordon Brown.</unknownNode><unknownNode>"We are going to wait for a general election to see what will happen because that's the ultimate test of public opinion.</unknownNode><unknownNode>"We are always continuing to monitor public opinion so if there's a surge of support then we will reconsider."</unknownNode><unknownNode>Sadly for Mr Brown's ego it seems Tony Blair's waxwork is still drawing the crowds. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Strange, I thought Ken Livingstone had returned to the Labour fold at the last mayoral election in 2004, having been expelled and fought as an independent in 2000.</unknownNode><unknownNode>But the word "Labour" appears nowhere on the home page of his website, though there is a small red rose - the Labour symbol - tucked away down at the bottom.</unknownNode><unknownNode>My BBC colleague Rhodri Jones has done a more extensive search, and the only mention of 'Labour' he can find is in Livingstone's biography, where it says he served as a "Labour councillor". </unknownNode><unknownNode>Simon Enright is today's programme producer. Here is his early email to the team.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Hello everyone,</unknownNode><unknownNode>10 Days to War Tonight is the first of the drama reconstructions of the events that led to the conflict in Iraq - it's called 10 Days to War. Starring Juliet Stevenson and Kate Ashfield in this episode we're behind the scenes at the foreign office as one of the government's most senior lawyers plans to resign over the legality of the war. We'll debate with General Sir Mike Jackson, QC Phillipe Sands and senior US legal advisor William Taft whether the war was legal and why it matters if it was or wasn't.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Budget But what else should we do on tonight's programme? Stephanie Flanders is working on a profile of Alistair Darling ahead of Wednesday's budget. Should we do more on the budget than that?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Weather Is there something Newsnight should be doing on the weather?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Simon</unknownNode><unknownNode>GAVISCON A Newsnight investigation has revealed claims that the drugs company, Reckitt Benckiser, blocked attempts to make a cheaper copy of one of its best-selling medicines - Gaviscon - which could have saved the NHS millions of pounds. Read Newsnight's exclusive report.</unknownNode><unknownNode>JERUSALEM  Earlier today thousands of mourners attended the funerals of eight Israeli students shot dead in Jerusalem. They were killed in a religious college by a gunman, who had smuggled an assault rifle into the library.  Diplomatic Editor Mark Urban joins us from Jerusalem.    LIB DEMS Big questions about Nick Clegg's leadership after this week's rebellion over Europe. Michael Crick reports from the Liberal Democrat Spring Conference. </unknownNode><unknownNode>And look out for next week's series of dramas - 10 Days to War - which examines the run-up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>Today I'm in Liverpool for the so-called spring conference of the Liberal Democrats (but it is of course still winter). Although I come here regularly to watch my team play football, it's years since I have done any political stories in this city - though in the eighties I seemed to be here all the time covering the activities of militant.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Liverpool is the home of the modern Liberal revival, where in the 1970s Sir Trevor Jones developed the idea  of pavement politics where council candidates dwell on voters' extremely local concerns, such as wobbly paving stones. Jones and his younger lieutenant Chris Renard (now Lord Renard) are probably the two most formidable party election campaigners of modern times in this country - and in Liverpool they managed to replace the Conservatives as the main opposition to labour. Indeed there hasn't been a conservative councillor here for a couple of decades. What happened in Liverpool has subsequently been repeated in other big northern cities, such as Manchester, Sheffield and Newcastle where the Conservatives have also been almost wiped out of local government, which poses a huge obstacle to David Cameron's ambitions.</unknownNode><unknownNode>But politics in Liverpool has always been different to anywhere else, focused on big name personalities, more American boss-style than anywhere else in Britain. And Liverpool politics - like the city itself - is often extremely rough, but invariably comes with a huge dollop of wit.</unknownNode><unknownNode>My favourite political story from Liverpool - which I've never managed to stand up - involved a Liberal activist turning up at the Conservative HQ very early in the morning on a polling day and injecting the milk bottles on the door step with laxative.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Talk about running for office. Talk about pavement politics.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Today's programme producer is Robert Morgan - here is his early email to the production team.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Good morning everyone,</unknownNode><unknownNode>We've got a strong investigation from Meirion and Martin Shankleman about Gaviscon. Who would have thought the makers of Gaviscon would have been scheming to cheat the National Health Service out of millions of pounds? The company is Reckitt Benckiser which makes everything from Dettol to Neurofen and Cillit Bang to LemSip. It made a billion pounds profit last year. A whistleblower from Reckitt came to see Newsnight and showed us internal emails and secret business plans which should have been shredded. They explained how they planned to block cheap generic copies of their medicine. We showed the papers to a top competition lawyer to see if what they were doing was illegal. He described them as "smoking guns". </unknownNode><unknownNode>I've put in a bid for the Public Health Minister, Dawn Primarolo and the head of the NHS. Let's discuss other possible bids too.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Other stories worth looking at include the aftermath of the Jerusalem killings. Will there be retaliation from the Israeli government? What about the diplomatic reaction from Libya at the UN? Michael and Hugh are at the Lib Dem Spring Conference.  There's more on the Jersey story today. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Any other ideas welcome. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Robert </unknownNode><unknownNode>Apologies all round today from many Westminster journalists, me included, after we slightly over-stated the size of last night&rsquo;s Labour rebellion on holding a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty.  There were, in fact, 28 Labour rebels, not 29.  I and everyone else, it seems, had forgotten that the Liverpool MP Bob Wareing has been thrown out of the Labour Party and now sits as an Independent. </unknownNode><unknownNode>In fact, it must be many decades since there were quite so many &lsquo;independents&rsquo; in the Commons, of various shades.  As well as Wareing, we&rsquo;ve got the Wyre Forest MP Richard Taylor, and the MP for Blaeneau Gwent, Dai Davies.  All three are full Independents.</unknownNode><unknownNode>On top of that, Clare Short is now 'Independent Labour', while on the Tory side, Andrew Pelling and Derek Conway, because of their different misdemeanours, are now obliged to sit as 'Independent Conservatives'.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>So six Independents in all.</unknownNode><unknownNode>In addition there&rsquo;s the strange case of George Galloway, who officially sits as a Respect MP, even though the Respect Party which elected him, and which he led, has now expelled him, and he represents a different Respect Party.</unknownNode><unknownNode>British, White and Working Class  Tonight a Newsnight Special ahead of tomorrow's launch of BBC Two's White Season, a series of programmes exploring the white working class experiences of 21st Century Britain. We have a specially commissioned poll from the polling organisation Populus to gauge white working class attitudes across a range of issues including the vexed subject of immigration. We'll debate the polls findings in the studio with among others the Culture Minister Margaret Hodge, the Talk Sport presenter Jon Gaunt, the RMT union leader Bob Crow and Shaun Bailey a youth worker and prospective Tory parliamentary candidate. We'll also be speaking to the BNP leader Nick Griffin.  Read Jackie Long's article here.</unknownNode><unknownNode/><unknownNode>Seroxat - GlaxoSmithKline Accused Also in the programme tonight a Government review has strongly criticised the pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline for not passing on crucial information to regulators about a link between the anti depressant Seroxat and suicidal tendencies in young people. The BBC reporter Shelley Joffre who first broke the story of the problems with Seroxat for Panorama, revisits the controversy and asks what if anything the Government can do. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Gaza Crisis Our Diplomatic Editor Mark Urban has just been inside Gaza and we'll ask him about the humanitarian impact of the sanctions there and the attempts by Egypt to broker a truce between the Palestinian militants and Israel.  See you later Kirsty</unknownNode><unknownNode>Tim Montgomerie of Conservativehome.com has written with details of an internet poll of 1,529 Conservative members, asking them: </unknownNode><unknownNode>"If the European Constitution (the Lisbon Treaty) has received Royal Assent and been adopted by the other 26 member states BEFORE the election of a Conservative Government, the Conservative Party should hold a retrospective referendum on the text.</unknownNode><unknownNode>76% agreed with that, and only 18% disagreed.</unknownNode><unknownNode>I can never understand why pro-referendum campaigners, especially Conservatives, don&rsquo;t make more of the pledge which David Cameron made in The Sun on 26 September last year, in which he said: </unknownNode><unknownNode>&ldquo;Today, I will give this cast-iron guarantee: If I become PM a Conservative government will hold a referendum on any EU treaty that emerges from these negotiations.&rdquo; </unknownNode><unknownNode>Not much wriggle room there.  After all, it was a &ldquo;cast-iron guarantee&rdquo; on &ldquo;any EU Treaty&rdquo;.  Perhaps the only excuse for watering down this commitment is that it was written amidst pre-election fever, and the widespread belief that Gordon Brown would call an election within a few days.  Yet it was hardly off-the-cuff, or to an insignificant audience.  It was a signed article to the newspapers three million or so readers.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Dan Kelly is today's programme producer - here is his early email to the team.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Good Morning,</unknownNode><unknownNode>Much of the programme tonight will discuss the British White Working Class - are they the forgotten group in British Society? Have they been marginalised by policy makers and the media? Newsnight has commissioned a poll of the British white working and middle classes with some fascinating results. </unknownNode><unknownNode>We have interviews with Culture Minister and MP for Barking Margaret Hodge, and Nick Griffin, leader of the BNP. We'll also have a wider discussion about the issue with some strong guests. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Seroxat The Government are set to announce a major tightening of the law governing drug trials when the Medicines and Healthcare Regulator reports on allegations that GlaxoSmithKline delayed informing the authorities that Seroxat increased the likelihood of suicide among teenagers. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Gaza A very strong report by human rights groups into the impact of the sanctions. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Other stories include ID cards - how the scheme will be rolled out. What other suggestions do you have? </unknownNode><unknownNode>Dan </unknownNode><unknownNode>So the government won a comfortable majority of 63 in its efforts to stop a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty.  The Conservatives emerged for once as the most united party on an European matter, whilst the Lib Dems, normally at one on EU matters, saw a quarter of their MPs defy the whips.</unknownNode><unknownNode>It was a lively debate, and my favourite moment came when Peter Lilley tried to compare the Foreign Secretary David Miliband with the corrupt and long-deceased former governor of Louisiana, Huey Long.  Long was once asked by an aide how he would explain to people why he'd ditched an election pledge.  "Tell 'em I lied," Long is reported to have said.</unknownNode><unknownNode>When Lilley said Miliband and his colleagues didn't even have the integrity of Huey Long, the deputy speaker said it was un-Parliamentary language and he should back down at once.  "I withdraw that remark," Mr Lilley duly said.  "They have the integrity of Huey Long."</unknownNode><unknownNode>After the laughter had died down, Mr Lilley was forced to withdraw that comment too! </unknownNode><unknownNode>EU referendum A rowdy time was had by all in the House of Commons today &ndash; and that was just at PMQs.  The three party leaders took each other to task over their respective stances on an EU referendum.  This was followed by a lengthy debate about a referendum on the EU Treaty. Is this democracy in action or a Westminster conspiracy to stifle real debate?  Our political editor Michael Crick will have the best bits for us &ndash; and the results of the vote itself, of course, which takes place at 7pm.  What will be the fallout of the rebellions likely to dog each of the party leaders?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Michael Crick&rsquo;s been blogging this afternoon &ndash; read what he has to say here.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Kenya The BBC has learnt of allegations of state-sanctioned violence in Kenya during the turmoil that followed last December's disputed presidential poll. Sources allege that meetings were hosted at the official residence of the president between the banned Mungiki militia and senior government figures. The Kenyan Government says the allegations are preposterous. Karen Allen has been investigating and Jeremy has been putting the allegations to the Kenyan Government spokesman.   </unknownNode><unknownNode>Read more on this story here.</unknownNode><unknownNode>US elections "For everyone here in Ohio and across America who has ever been counted out but refused to be knocked out, for everyone who has stumbled but stood right back up, and for everyone who works hard and never gives up, this one is for you."</unknownNode><unknownNode>Hillary Clinton is back in the race after taking Texas, Ohio and Rhode Island in yesterday&rsquo;s Democratic primaries.  But Barack Obama took Vermont and still has more delegates overall than his rival.</unknownNode><unknownNode>So it&rsquo;s no clearer who will go up against that other comeback kid John McCain &ndash; now confirmed as the Republican nominee &ndash; in the fight for the White House.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Peter Marshall is in Washington to ask &ldquo;what next?&rdquo;  It could all come down to the super-delegates &ndash; but who are these mysterious voters with the power to turn this race on its head yet again?</unknownNode><unknownNode>HIV scandal Also tonight, Madeleine Holt investigates the so-called "bareback" gay porn industry. The unique selling point of this genre of films is that they show unprotected sex - something which has been taboo in gay erotica since the emergence of HIV in the 1980s. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Our investigation highlights fears that some of the performers in bareback are becoming infected on camera. And that footage, which effectively documents people unwittingly becoming HIV positive, is now on sale. Some surprising names are now profiting from bareback - including one of Britain's most respected gay businesses, which has hitherto had a long track record of campaigning for HIV awareness. </unknownNode><unknownNode>There is concern that the popularity of bareback marks a worrying shift in attitudes. Health officials fear it echoes a wider complacency about HIV among a generation which wasn&rsquo;t even born when the government first employed icebergs to try to frighten people into wearing condoms.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Read more about Madeleine&rsquo;s report here</unknownNode><unknownNode>Do join Jeremy at 10.30pm on BBC Two. </unknownNode><unknownNode>I hear that Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg has already accepted one resignation from a front bench member over the issue of holding a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Carol Rubra is today's programme producer. Here is her early email to the production team.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Good morning,</unknownNode><unknownNode>We have lots of goodies in the programme tonight.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Hillary makes a comeback, but how much of a comeback is it?  Peter Marshall and Ben are in Washington. Let's discuss treatment ideas and angles for them to explore and discussion guests.</unknownNode><unknownNode>We have a very strong film from Karen Allen containing new allegations of state sanctioned violence in the recent riots in Kenya. We are bidding for a Kenyan govt response.</unknownNode><unknownNode>We also have Madeleine Holt and Ed Main's film which didn't run yesterday. It's an investigation into the health risks of so-called bareback gay porn - that is films showing men having unprotected sex. Following the investigation, three films have been withdrawn from sale. There have been concerns from within the gay community that performers are being infected with HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases. Read the article here.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Today is also the day when MPs finally vote on the whether there should be a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Any thoughts on a playout?</unknownNode><unknownNode>HILLARY CLINTON'S LAST STAND? The races for both the Democratic and Republican US presidential nominations could be settled as four states vote in a major round of primary elections. The main focus is on Ohio and Texas but votes are also taking place in Rhode Island and Vermont. Democratic front-runner Barack Obama has said rival Hillary Clinton may have to quit if he wins in Texas and Ohio, but she has vowed to stay the course.  Arizona Senator John McCain could be confirmed as the Republican candidate. Peter Marshall will have the latest from the US and we'll be on the ground in Ohio and Texas - watch his interview with Forest Whitaker.</unknownNode><unknownNode>We also hope to be joined live by a big Hillary Clinton supporter.</unknownNode><unknownNode>LIBERAL DEMOCRATS  MPs will decide tomorrow whether to have a referendum on the new European Union Treaty. The Government says it's not necessary, but is facing a Commons rebellion from up to 30 Labour MPs. The Liberal Democrat leadership are urging their MPs to abstain with a three line whip, but a number of front benchers are threatening to support the call for a public vote and could face the sack. This could prove to be the first big test for the new Liberal Democrat leader, Nick Clegg. He joins us live.</unknownNode><unknownNode>GAZA The American secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, has said she's concerned about the recent violence between Israel and the Palestinians, but still believes a peace deal can be achieved this year.  Speaking in Ramallah, Dr Rice again urged Palestinian leaders to resume talks with Israel. The Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, suspended negotiations at the weekend in protest at Israel's recent offensive in the Gaza Strip, which has killed more than 120 people. Mr Abbas said that while he wanted peace, he warned that the security needs of Israelis could not take precedence over the rights of Palestinians. Diplomatic Editor, Mark Urban joins us from Jerusalem.</unknownNode><unknownNode>HIV Three films have been withdrawn from sale following a Newsnight investigation into the health risks of so-called bareback gay porn - which shows men have unprotected sex.  It follows concerns within the gay community that performers are being infected with HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases. Two of the DVDs featured footage from a week-long shoot during which eight British models had sex with each other in multiple combinations without condoms. Four of those who took part were diagnosed as HIV positive soon after. One of the men told the BBC he was distressed that footage which he believed showed him becoming infected had been put on sale. Read Madeleine Holt's article here.</unknownNode><unknownNode>It's the glamour of Obama. </unknownNode><unknownNode>The candidate, who Hillary Clinton accuses of relying on charisma rather than content, has recruited more than half of Hollywood. </unknownNode><unknownNode>George Clooney likes him. Susan Sarandon is besotted (her first choice, John Edwards, having withdrawn from the battle) and Forest Whitaker, Oscar winner and The Last King of Scotland, has been a fan for years. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Against that, Hillary is left with the geriatric lothario Jack Nicholson, who has deployed a line from A Few Good Men about how taking orders from a woman is "sexy".  Watch Clinton advert.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Taking the view that we already know far too much about Jack's libido, we turned to Mr Whitaker at Obama HQ in Dallas for the Last King's view about the man he wants to be the next President...</unknownNode><unknownNode>Watch Peter Marshall's interview with Forest Whitaker</unknownNode><unknownNode>Today's programme producer is Robert Morgan - here is his early email to the production team.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Good morning everyone,</unknownNode><unknownNode>There are some good stories around today. It's Hillary Clinton's make or break day today against Barack Obama as voting in four US primaries  take place. Peter Marshall and Ben Bevington are in the US for the programme.

Playout thoughts? </unknownNode><unknownNode>Robert </unknownNode><unknownNode> </unknownNode><unknownNode>Gordon Brown looks set for some embarrassment when the National Executive Committee of the Labour Party meets next Monday (10 March 2008) to pick a new General Secretary following last autumn&rsquo;s resignation of Peter Watt over the David Abrahams proxy loans affair.  The Prime Minister&rsquo;s candidate is David Pitt-Watson, who was recruited by the party from the City of London in 1997 and spent a couple of years as Labour&rsquo;s finance director and assistant general secretary, when he was credited with helping turn round Labour&rsquo;s finances.  Yet most of Pitt-Watson&rsquo;s career has been spent in the City, where until recently he ran Hermes Focus Asset Management, and where he has built a reputation as a leading advocate of greater activism by shareholders.  Pitt-Watson, who&rsquo;s been rejected for the post in the past, was also a significant financial backer of Gordon Brown&rsquo;s leadership election.  He is seem by the Prime Minister and his allies as having sufficient business brain and enough of an independent background to shake the party up following its recent funding scandals, but also to sort out the party&rsquo;s mounting debts once more.  </unknownNode><unknownNode> 						Continue reading "All right Jack?" 					</unknownNode><unknownNode>24-Hour Drinking   We were told it could lead to a caf&eacute; culture, sensible drinking and a decline in drink-related violence, but has it? Newsnight has conducted its own review of the 24-hour licensing laws, ahead of the Government's official publication, expected tomorrow. What has been the real impact of liberalising the law? (Remember Boozenight?)</unknownNode><unknownNode>Gaza Hamas declared "victory" this morning after Israeli troops pulled out of the Gaza Strip after days of fighting in which more than 100 people have died - but the Israeli Prime Minister said military action would continue.  So what are the prospects for peace? Mark Urban reports from Israel and we speak to senior Israeli and Hamas politicians.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Obama's Foreign Policy So how would Barack Obama have handled this weeks events in Gaza, Russia or Iraq and would we have even noticed the difference? We'll be speaking to his senior foreign policy adviser, Samantha Power. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Much amusement in the BBC office at Millbank this afternoon as we all watched the television feed from the House of Lords, and observed a leading Liberal Democrat peeress sitting - or reclined - right behind her party colleague Lord Thomas of Gresford as he spoke at great length in a debate on immigration.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Lord Thomas's arguments obviously required the utmost concentration. </unknownNode><unknownNode>I'd probably be hauled up before the Lords authorities if I were to name names.  So I won't. And I'd be in big trouble next time I visited Edinburgh and bumped into her husband, a prominent Scottish journalist.</unknownNode><unknownNode>I am amused to see that several prominent artists have donated works to Ken Livingstone&rsquo;s re-election campaign for London mayor, among them Banksy, Anthony Gormley, Jeremy Deller and Marc Quinn.  The works are due to be auctioned this Thursday at the Aquarium Gallery.  A new form of canvassing, I suppose.</unknownNode><unknownNode>I trust, however that Mr Livingstone and the Labour Party will be registering these donations with the Electoral Commission.  So far there&rsquo;s no sign on the Electoral Commission register that Ken Livingstone is even running for London Mayor, let alone of any donations to his campaign.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>I was also interested to see that the Sunday Times yesterday followed up my story on Friday about Labour failing to register with the Commission the cut-price work performed by their advertising agency Saatchi and Saatchi.  In line with what Saatchi&rsquo;s Communications Director Eleanor Conroy told Newsnight last November, she told the Sunday Times on Friday that the work is &ldquo;heavily discounted because we are so keen to work on it and so passionate about it &hellip; We give them a massive discount.&rdquo;  But later Ms Conroy changed her tune, as she did with Newsnight, and said &ldquo;it is not a discount&rdquo;.  All very odd.</unknownNode><unknownNode>But the law is clear. And discount of more than 10% has to be registered as a donation.  And &ldquo;massive&rdquo; sounds to me, like it was more than 10%. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Dan Kelly is today's programme producer - here is his early email to the team. Leave your thoughts below on what we should cover.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Good morning all.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Gaza Hamas declared "victory" this morning after Israeli troops pulled out of the Gaza Strip after days of fighting that have killed more than 100 people - but senior Israeli officials said the conflict had merely entered an "interval&rdquo; for a visit by the US Secretary of State. Rockets from Hamas hit the Israeli city of Ashkelon today, and Israeli air strikes have continued.  Mark Urban is in Israel. Which guests would you like to see on this? What other thoughts do you have on the story?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Drinking The government is due to publish its review of 24-hour drinking tomorrow - local government chiefs have already been highly critical.

Are they irrelevant to the main concern of many British people - the arrival of immigrants from Eastern Europe?  In fact just how many people are the new rules expected to exclude who were not previously? We have the figures.    Which way Russia?  They are now speaking of "Putinism" in Russia - and it is always a bit of a warning sign when a politician becomes an "-ism&rdquo;.    But what will this weekend's presidential elections mean for Russia's future? A former Kremlin adviser will discuss it with a leading Putin sceptic.   Labour's Spring in the Step?  We've sent Michael Crick off to the Labour spring Conference to see if the party regulars feel any optimism about their chances of winning the next election, after some dismal showings in the opinion polls. Don't forget to read Michael's blog.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Newsnight Review And then on Review, Sarfraz Manzoor, Kerry Shale and Rachel Campbell-Johnston join Kirsty to discuss: Nicole Kidman, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Jack Black in Noah Baumbach's Margot at the Wedding; Hanif Kureishi's new novel Something To Tell You; drama White Girl and documentary Last Orders, both from BBC Two's White Season; and an exhibition of Works by Banksy at the Andipa Gallery, London. More information on all those on the Newsnight Review website. </unknownNode><unknownNode>It's a great mystery. You'll recall that last summer the Labour Party announced - with some glee - that they'd recruited the advertising agency Saatchi and Saatchi to work on the next election campaign. It was heralded as a great coup for Gordon Brown at the time - Mrs Thatcher's favourite advertising agency was now working for Labour. And Saatchi and Saatchi worked frantically for their new political clients in late August, September and early October. The account manager Robert Senior and his colleagues came up with the clever slogan, "Not Flash, Just Gordon". And you can imagine the intense frustration and dismay amongst the Saatchi and Saatchi team in their offices in Charlotte Street when GB suddenly decided there wouldn't be an autumn election after all. </unknownNode><unknownNode> 						Continue reading "Should Labour have declared Saatchi work as donation?" 					</unknownNode><unknownNode>Simon Enright is today's programme producer - here's his early email to the team.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Hello All,</unknownNode><unknownNode>So do we get an extra day's pay for working an extra day this year?

M&amp;S has announced that in their food department customers are going to be charged 5p per plastic bag in an effort to reduce consumer demand. A good move or a publicity stunt when there are many other ways M&amp;S could be moving ahead towards their promise of being carbon neutral by 2012? There are other ways - The Irish Government introduced a plastic bag tax in 2002 and claims use has fallen by 90%. Even China has banned ultra thin bags and free bags will be banned from June of this year - as a result the country's leading plastic bag producers closed down. So is this just &lsquo;greenwash&rsquo; or a good thing?  We will also debate whether the environmental lobby is ruling our lives.      Afghanistan It has just been announced that Prince Harry has been fighting the Taleban in Afghanistan -  and as luck would have it tonight we have a film from Alastair Leithead about the strategy in that country. Six years after the fall of the Taleban, President Karzai has control of just 30% of the country, US National Intelligence Director Michael McConnell told a Senate committee. The Taleban hold 10%. So what are the US the British and Afghan governments getting right and wrong in Afghanistan?  The British in Helmand province may think experience in Northern Ireland, and 1950s Malaya puts them at the forefront of counter insurgency, but the Americans running the south east now seem well ahead, as Alastair Leithead reports.     See you later, Kirsty</unknownNode><unknownNode>The Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Ian Blair seems a bit miffed that neither the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, nor the Commons Privileges Committee referred the Derek Conway case to him for a possible criminal investigation.  One former MP who is a barrister tells me there may be strong constitutional arguments why the police couldn't pursue this case. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Technically parliament itself is a court of law, and so Derek Conway has been tried and convicted by Parliament, and so if the police were to investigate Conway and he ended up in an ordinary criminal court, he would effectively be tried twice, and one court would be challenging the verdict of another. Article nine of the 1689 Bill of Rights - the article which establishes Parliamentary privilege - says: "That the freedom of speech and debates or proceedings in Parliament ought not to be impeached or questioned in any court or place out of Parliament."  So any outside court considering the Conway could therefore be deemed to be questioning what Parliament has already decided. </unknownNode><unknownNode>No doubt some constitutional anorak will tell me that my former MP friend has got it all wrong, and that this is all bonkers.  But maybe not. </unknownNode><unknownNode>There's a growing war on plastic shopping bags. Marks and Spencer plans to charge customers 5p for them in an effort to reduce demand. The Irish government introduced a consumer plastic bag tax in 2002 and says use fell by more than 90%. Even China - not often regarded as a leading light on environmental issues - has banned ultra-thin bags and free bags will be banned from June this year. One of the country's leading plastic bag manufacturers has closed down as a result.</unknownNode><unknownNode>So isn't it now a no-brainer that the UK followed suit?</unknownNode><unknownNode>I said some weeks ago that we'd be able to assess the importance and success of Gordon Brown's new chief adviser Stephen Carter, if he manages to bring in a few more high-powered people to beef up the Downing Street staff.  The word for some weeks has been that Brown has been negotiating to appoint Clive Jones, the former head of ITV News and the Regions, to overhaul Number Ten's communications strategy.</unknownNode><unknownNode>All very amusing, for Clive Jones was once David Cameron's boss at Carlton Television, where the Tory leader worked as Director of Communications.  Indeed Jones could soon be doing for Gordon Brown, what David Cameron did for him.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>How satisfying for Brown to think that he employs his opponent's former boss.  Indeed Jones could be just the man to advise all about David Cameron's strengths and weaknesses.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>"And," one mischievous Labour MP has suggested to me, "if David Cameron ever had a drugs issue in those days, then Jones may know all about it".</unknownNode><unknownNode>UPDATE I have now been told by a senior Downing Street source that the story is 'rubbish' and that Clive Jones is not joining Number Ten. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Today's programme producer is Robert Morgan - here is his early email to the production team.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Good morning everyone,</unknownNode><unknownNode>The programme is wide open today.

Could this explain the increasing number of "phantom withdrawals" form customers&rsquo; cards reported across the UK? </unknownNode><unknownNode>The anti-depression report plastered across today's papers is interesting - but will it feel very old by tonight? Do you have guest suggestions that could move the story on?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Jackie is in Jersey. Senator Syvret claims to have evidence that previous child abuse allegations  on the island were covered up. We'll look at the evidence and see if it's worth pursuing.</unknownNode><unknownNode>The Turkish Government is to publish a new version of the Hadith - the collected sayings of the Prophet Muhammad - taking out what are sometimes regarded as harsh and misogynistic messages. What will be the reaction across the Islamic world? Could this be the beginning of a "Reformation" in Islam (as some claim)? Who could we have on to discuss this?</unknownNode><unknownNode>There are also some interesting developments on the MPs&rsquo; expenses story at Westminster.</unknownNode><unknownNode>How should we cover these stories? What other suggestions do you have?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Dan </unknownNode><unknownNode>I forgot to mention, we have an interview with Ralph Nader too </unknownNode><unknownNode>Jeremy has spent the afternoon speaking to Nobel prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz about his new book - The Three Trillion Dollar War. It is an attempt to put a price on how much was spent invading Iraq. He tries to put numerical values not only on the damage to the world's economy but also the personal cost to those who fought and the many who died in the war. The book is the latest in the Newsnight Book Club - read an extract and leave your thoughts here.</unknownNode><unknownNode>But we'll start the programme with the police investigation in Jersey which looks to be uncovering remains at the site which once was a children's home. Is there something about the way Jersey runs its government which allowed this to go unchecked? We'll debate.</unknownNode><unknownNode>There were cheers for the Speaker when he called "Order, Order" in the house today; that after a rough weekend of headlines calling for his resignation. But it does seem that his parliamentary colleagues are giving him their support. For now. Does that damage the reputation of the House? We'll speak to an interesting figure who in his time was also responsible for damaging parliament's reputation.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Finally we have a report from Chad - not somewhere we often take our cameras. Many refugees from Darfur are sheltering in the country but they are far from safe. The complicated local political situation leaves Chad's borders vulnerable and the French peace-keeping troops have split loyalties. It is a difficult but important film to watch.</unknownNode><unknownNode>The Three Trillion Dollar War by Nobel award-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz and Linda Bilmes of Harvard University is an attempt to put a price on how much was spent invading Iraq. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Stiglitz and Bilmes try to put numerical values not only on the damage to the world's economy but also on the more personal costs of the war. The book counts direct spending by the US and UK before going on to cost everything from lives lost and damage done in the Middle East to replacing military hardware and caring for veterans in the West.</unknownNode><unknownNode>The extract below is from the preface.</unknownNode><unknownNode> 						Continue reading "The Three Trillion Dollar War by Stiglitz and Bilmes" 					</unknownNode><unknownNode>Simon Enright is today's programme producer.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Good Morning,</unknownNode><unknownNode>What has gone on in Jersey? And is there culpability from the political system there? We're trying to scramble a team out there. Any other lines we should pursue?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Speaker Michael Martin's broken no Commons rules. His spokesman just resigned because he'd told the press an untruth. And it was not Michael Martin's fault. So what is going on and has Martin lost the confidence of MPs or not? (Watch David Grossman&rsquo;s original report on this story.)</unknownNode><unknownNode>We have a film from Chad about the role of French troops in the developing crisis there as refugees flood across the border from Sudan and Darfur.</unknownNode><unknownNode>And we also have an interview with Professor Joseph Stiglitz about his latest book looking at the economics of the war in Iraq. </unknownNode><unknownNode>We possibly do need one more thing but what?</unknownNode><unknownNode>OFGEM's largest ever fine on a company? The Fair-trade debate - sales are up but the Adam Smith Institute is characterising Fair Trade as unfair Or should we debate who had the best dress at the Oscars?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Bring your answers to the morning meeting. OR post them below.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Simon</unknownNode><unknownNode>IRAQ Did British soldiers really execute up to 20 Iraqi civilians in southern Iraq, as was claimed in a press conference today? Lawyers published a dossier concerning the aftermath of a gun battle in 2004 known as "The Battle of Danny Boy" named after the checkpoint where it took place. But how reliable is the evidence, based on the accounts of Iraqi civilians who were blindfolded at the time?   OBAMA Who is Barack Obama? He is now definitively the front runner for the Democratic nomination, although Hillary Clinton may make an Alamo-like last stand in Texas and Ohio in ten days. But if it really is Obama versus McCain in November, what kind of contest is that shaping up to be? And will the Republicans simply paint Obama as the most left wing Democratic candidate for 40 years? We'll hear live from a top Obama adviser, Senator Tom Daschle.</unknownNode><unknownNode>"All In The Mind" Alastair Campbell has written a work of fiction - no not another Government dossier - but a novel about a psychiatrist "his patients and family, and the pressures they bring to bear upon each other&rdquo;. So can Alastair become a successful man of letters? We interview him live on the programme. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Today's programme producer is Dan Kelly - here is his early email to the production team.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Morning all.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Open to lots of suggestions today on stories, guests and treatments. Plenty of stories around but what should we make our own?  </unknownNode><unknownNode>Should agency workers have the same pay and conditions as other workers? A Private Members Bill is expected to receive strong support from Labour MPs today despite the opposition of the Government and claims from the CBI that 250,000 jobs could go. Can we shine a light on to the world of agency workers? What are their conditions and what are the consequences? </unknownNode><unknownNode>Peter Marshall is working on a profile of Barack Obama, which guests would you like off the back? </unknownNode><unknownNode>Other stories we could do include allegations of torture by British troops in Iraq. Serbia and reports that the Turkish army has entered northern Iraq.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Please come with lots of ideas.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Dan      </unknownNode><unknownNode>  </unknownNode><unknownNode>Rendition</unknownNode><unknownNode>The Foreign Secretary has made an extraordinary apology to MPs over extraordinary rendition. Until now the government's always been adamant that British soil has never been used in the process of moving terrorist suspects around the globe, to or from countries where they could be subject to torture.  But today David Miliband admitted that, in actual fact, two such planes DID touch down on British territory a full six years ago - on the island of Diego Garcia. Why hadn't this come to light before now? Because the US government has only just informed the government about the flights, apparently, even though they are supposed to ask permission of the government before using British territory in such a way. Two parliamentary inquiries since 2002, then, have been misled by the government.  Kirsty is speaking to the legal adviser to the US State Department John Bellinger about this right now - and will be asking why details of these flights have taken six years to come to light. And we'll be asking where it leaves the &ldquo;special relationship&rdquo;.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Suffolk Murders</unknownNode><unknownNode>Steve Wright has been convicted of murdering five women in Ipswich at the end of 2006. What would motivate a man to commit such unspeakable crimes? Were they a tragic, isolated series of killings or do they speak to deeper issues in society? </unknownNode><unknownNode> MP WAS bugged </unknownNode><unknownNode>An investigation ordered by the Home Office has found that the Labour MP, Sadiq Khan, was bugged on two occasions when he met a terrorist suspect in prison. The Home Secretary said that senior police officers did not realise he was an MP and that correct procedures were followed. But how seriously can we take the results of the inquiry given that it took no evidence from the whistleblower who made the original allegations? </unknownNode><unknownNode> Euro millions</unknownNode><unknownNode>We've heard stories of MPs employing relatives to do next-to-nothing. But it seems we&rsquo;ve got nothing on the European Parliament. The European Union's internal anti-fraud squad has confirmed it's investigating alleged abuses of MEPs' expenses totalling about &pound;100m. David Grossman is working up a handy guide to Euro-expense wheezes.</unknownNode><unknownNode>And - in case you weren't watching last night - we're celebrating Jeremy's News Presenter of the Year Award from the Royal Television Society. Some of his best interviews from the past year are on the website.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Liz Gibbons is the programme producer today - here is her early email to the team.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Hello </unknownNode><unknownNode>Lots of room for your ideas on the prog tonight&hellip;</unknownNode><unknownNode>Some early thoughts&hellip;. </unknownNode><unknownNode>MEPs expenses - we've done well on this story in the past. Can we move it on still further tonight? </unknownNode><unknownNode>British Gas profits - what's the best angle for us ? Competition or fuel poverty ?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Northern Rock - likely to have a rocky road through parliament today because of hiving off of we should watch.</unknownNode><unknownNode>There's a demo in Serbia later this afternoon. </unknownNode><unknownNode>And we might have a film from Chad. Or we might not. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Immigration A funny thing is happening, these days. The immigration debate is as hot as ever - but now no-one is talking about race. They're talking about speed of change - squeezed public resources and overcrowding. But the 'colour card' as such, is gone. Tonight, as the Home Secretary asks new immigrants to 'prove their worth', we ask whether it's just the language that's changed, whether the debate has become more 'grown up' or whether the two HAVE become decoupled. The immigration issue has often got political parties in trouble in the past - but right now, politicians know they cant afford to ignore it. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Spy Satellites? Calling Bruce Willis Life, as Woody Allen once put it, often imitates art. And today the Pentagon's concerns appear to come straight out of the action movie Armageddon.  The US is standing by to shoot down a satellite which they say could cause great damage if it crashed to earth. They got rather upset when China tried something similar last year. Indeed those actions prompted fears of a space arms race. Except this time, they tell us, it's very different. All well and good. But the Russian's simply don't believe them and have branded it a cover for weapon testing. Anyway, the testosterone is flying, as it were. We'll be gathering Russia and US watchers to tell us where this is heading.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Kosovo When Germany recognised Croatian independence in 1991 it was explosive and led to the Balkan conflict. Today, it has formally recognized Kosovo's independence, but only after France, the US and Britain did so earlier in the week.  The circumstances are different but there are historical resonances. So can war be avoided this time around? </unknownNode><unknownNode>Sovereign Wealth Funds These massive state owned investment funds have nearly three trillion dollars to invest - slightly more than Britain's entire GDP. They can come to the rescue of troubled enterprises - and banks that need a bail out. But what do we actually know about these naturally secretive organizations - rising, as so many do, from the deserts of the Middle East? Stephanie Flanders is on the case &ndash; and you can read her analysis of the cash and controversy surrounding sovereign wealth funds here. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Today's programme producer is Carol Rubra - here is her early email to the team.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Good morning,</unknownNode><unknownNode>There are a few interesting stories around today but there's lots of space for other things, or a different lead? Please come with your own ideas.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Immigration and citizenship. We'll find out more about what the green paper is proposing this morning. The DNA disc which sat in a drawer for a year, reforms of incapacity benefit, reforms to rules for long term unemployed.</unknownNode><unknownNode>I'd like us to look at the spy satellite story - the US have said they will shoot down a spy satellite which will otherwise crash into earth sometime in the next 24 hours. China and Russia have complained. Is this the next step in the space arms race or a necessary act to protect the earth?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Our film today: Stephanie has a film about the secretive world of Sovereign Wealth Funds, massive state owned investment funds that have risen out of the oil economies and now have trillions of dollars to invest around the world.</unknownNode><unknownNode>And there is space for another story so please come with ideas on what we should do and how. Perhaps something light for the end of the programme?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Fidel Castro has finally stepped down as President of Cuba 49 years after the Cuban Revolution. Tonight we consider his legacy for Cuba, the Cold War and revolutionaries (and would-be revolutionaries) across the world. George Galloway and a leading Cuban American opponent of Castro will be discussing the president's legacy.</unknownNode><unknownNode>The Pakistan elections have delivered a significant blow to President Musharraf. The PPP, the party of the late Benazir Bhutto say they hope to form a coalition Government with another opposition party. So what happens next? Should Musharraf fear impeachment? Mark Urban reports from Pakistan.</unknownNode><unknownNode>There has been a powerful press conference this afternoon concerning the young people in and around Bridgend who have taken their lives in recent months. The police and parents of one of the teenagers strongly criticised media coverage of suicides and said that some of the reporting may even have encouraged some young people to kill themselves.  The police say they have found no evidence of suicide pacts or any other link between the deaths. Tonight, we ask, have the media helped to create a phenomenon they claim to simply have reported?</unknownNode><unknownNode>And, finally, we'll have Venezuelan pianist Gabriela Montero live in the studio. She's brilliant at improvisation and she'll play out on a piece based on a viewer's suggestion to our website. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Today's programme producer is Dan Kelly - here is his early email to the production team.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Morning all,</unknownNode><unknownNode>Fidel Castro has finally stepped down as President of Cuba, 49 years after the Cuban Revolution. It's a great opportunity to discuss his legacy on Cuba, the Cold War, Latin America and revolutionaries (and would-be revolutionaries) across the world. Who should we have on to discuss this? Lots of suggestions please. </unknownNode><unknownNode>The Pakistan elections have delivered a significant blow to President Musharraf. The PPP of late PM Benazir Bhutto and the PML-N led by Nawaz Sharif, now share more than half the seats, though all the results are not yet in. So what happens next? Should Musharraf fear impeachment? Mark Urban is on the story, do you have any suggestions for guests?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Northern Rock. I've got a few thoughts on how we could push this on today, but what do you think, or should we even do it at all?</unknownNode><unknownNode>And, finally, we'll have Venezuelan pianist Gabriela Montero live in the studio. She's brilliant at improvisation and she'll play out on a piece based on a viewer's suggestion. We need to choreograph this very carefully.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>Dan </unknownNode><unknownNode/><unknownNode/><unknownNode/><unknownNode> </unknownNode><unknownNode>Jeremy's presenting the programme tonight. Northern Rock  We'll have the latest on the fallout from the decision to nationalise Northern Rock. A few minutes ago David Cameron called for Alistair Darling to be removed from his post. Where does all this leave the government's reputation for economic competence? And would the Tories&rsquo; plan for the Rock be any sounder? We expect to hear from a Treasury minister and a senior Conservative. </unknownNode><unknownNode>"Draft" weapons dossier published The government vigorously opposed its publication, but lost the battle. A first draft of the notorious dossier on Iraq's weapons capability has been released under Freedom of Information legislation. The draft was never released to the Hutton inquiry nor to Lord Butler's inquiry into the evidence that led to war. It sheds more light on the key role that political advisers had in the presentation of sensitive intelligence.  More details on the programme...</unknownNode><unknownNode>Pakistan elections  The polls have already closed in Pakistan's parliamentary elections. The election is supposed to ease the transition to civilian democracy after eight years of military rule - but after weeks of bloody violence, and the assassination of key opposition leader Benazir Bhutto, it's likely that the outcome will lead to yet more instability and chaos. Mark Urban has spent the past week travelling across the country, speaking to top politicians and ordinary Pakistanis about the chance of peace.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Diana inquest It was never likely to be a quiet day in court. But Mohammed Al Fayed's first day of evidence at the inquest into the death of Diana has proven more explosive than anyone could have imagined.  He's referred to Prince Phillip as a "Nazi", and suggested that Prince Charles was part of the alleged murder plot, hoping to clear the decks so he could marry Camilla Parker Bowles.  Has any of this led us any closer to the truth about her death? Possibly not. But we've sent our reporter Steve Smith along for the spectacle.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Today's programme producer is Liz Gibbons - here is her early email to the production team.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Hello all </unknownNode><unknownNode>Masses around - what should we concentrate on?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Northern Rock How did we get here? Why did it take as long as it did to get here? And what might the political/economic consequences be? David Grossman is working on a piece. There's a Gordon Brown press conference at 11, a press conference with new Northern Rock boss Ron Sadler expected this afternoon and a Commons statement due. What are the key issues we want to address and who we want to hear from live?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Pakistan - Mark Urban is there for us working on a film assessing the impact of the elections. We should have a good sense of early results by the time we're on air.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Kosovo - officially recognised by EU and US today. Key interviews? (Watch Allan Little&rsquo;s Kosovo essay from last week)</unknownNode><unknownNode>Al Fayed giving evidence at Diana inquest - Steve Smith is in court. Is there a discussion to be done?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Liz </unknownNode><unknownNode>Two weeks ago I appeared on Newsnight to talk about the bids in for Northern Rock. I went as near as I could to suggesting that the pullout of Olivant, leaving Branson plus the in-house "bid", left the Rock very close to Nationalisation. The reason? Both bids effectively only offered half a billion of new money in return for the government removing risk on 24bn worth of debt. Of course only Treasury people could be privy to the deep inner mathematics of the bids but even a jackass such as myself could work out that this possibly did not represent best value for taxpayers' money. </unknownNode><unknownNode>I had strong belief there and then that it would have to be temporarily nationalised. Why? For a reason you can't stake your reputation on: the tone of voice of everybody in government I spoke to betrayed their despair at the non-appearance of decent bids from the private sector. When I asked Downing Street that night: "are you planning to nationalise the Rock" the reply was "Treasury matter, Paul" - as in Father Jack Hackett's famous all-purpose brush off "That would be an ecumenical matter..."</unknownNode><unknownNode> 						Continue reading "Wish I'd taken a punt now, really - on the Rock!" 					</unknownNode><unknownNode>Tonight on Newsnight, yob culture and then on Newsnight Review, culture..   There have been a series of high profile stories this week involving inhuman behaviour by children. Gareth Avery was brutally attacked because he confronted a group of young drunks relieving themselves in his garden. </unknownNode><unknownNode>A 15-year-old girl admitted filming a fatal attack on Gavin Waterhouse in West Yorkshire by a 19 year old and a 17 year old. She then showed the footage to others even after it was known that Mr Waterhouse had died. </unknownNode><unknownNode>This was the response from a local criminal lawyer: &ldquo;More than ever before young people are turning to extreme violence, in some cases for no reason other than entertainment. This case illustrates the gross callousness some teenagers are capable of." </unknownNode><unknownNode>Also this week Helen Newlove, the widow of Garry Newlove who was beaten to death by drunk youths has called for harsh measures for those selling alcohol to minors, and the ending of the glamorising of drinking on TV.    Tonight we devote the programme to trying to make some sense of what is going on. Why does no other country in Europe seem to have the same binge drinking nihilistic culture among it teenagers? </unknownNode><unknownNode>Why are some parents not able to exert any influence or control over anti-social behaviour? Are violent attacks by teenagers really up or is it that their ferocity distorts the true story? Is it adults who have let children down?  </unknownNode><unknownNode>We hope to bring together in the studio tonight a teenager, a magistrate, a teacher, the police, a parent and the Children's Commissioner who said this week that the so-called "Mosquito" measure, a high-pitched sound used to disperse children from  street corners, infringes their human rights.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>Mark Kermode predicted on Review last week that Julie Christie wouldn't win an Oscar but she would get a Bafta for her performance in Away From Her. </unknownNode><unknownNode>In fact, the surprise Bafta winner was the French star of La Vie en Rose, Marion Cotillard.  This is the fourth time that Julie Christie has been nominated for a leading actress Oscar - she won for Darling in 1966. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Now she is playing a woman who is struck down by Alzheimer&rsquo;s and decides to move into a home. The first-time director Sarah Polley co-starred with Christie in The Secret Life of Words. </unknownNode><unknownNode>This week's panel - Bidisha, Rosie Boycott and Michael Gove - will be discussing Away From Her which has been re-released as a result of the Oscar nomination. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Art v commerce</unknownNode><unknownNode>By the way, one journalist blogged recently that they play Review roulette each week, predicting who will be on the panel. Guess they never read the email. Other people have told me they play Fantasy Guests. Do let me know who are yours.    Meanwhile, our real panel will also be discussing Speed-the-Plow, a Mamet revival on at The Old Vic in London. It stars the theatre's artistic director Kevin Spacey and Jeff Goldblum as two Hollywood producers confronting the age old clash of art versus commerce.    Our third item is a work which was voted best novel of 2007 by Time magazine in the States. It took Junot D&iacute;az 11 years to write The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao after his highly acclaimed short story collection Drown.  The language of the book is bizarrely imaginative, switching between the Spanish of Oscar&rsquo;s native Dominican Republic, the fantasy speak of Tolkien, sci-fi and street slang.    Amy Winehouse did brilliantly at the Grammys this week even though her visa came in too late for her to travel to the States. Whether down to her success or not, there is now a real vogue for young British women singer-songwriters. </unknownNode><unknownNode>We'll be looking at that new generation - Laura Marling who at 18 is picking up comparisons with Joni Mitchell; Adele whose album 19 is named for her age; and Duffy, the Welsh singer whom experts have picked as one of the key sounds of 2008.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>Do join us at 11pm. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Martha Kearney</unknownNode><unknownNode/><unknownNode>A number of viewers were unhappy with the Sharia law discussion we held last week (watch it here) with Douglas Murray from the Centre for Social Cohesion, Professor Tariq Ramadan of Oxford University, and the Rt Rev Stephen Lowe, Bishop of Hulme.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Editor Peter Barron went on the BBC's Newswatch to discuss the debate and coverage. Watch the programme here. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Last night during Steve Smith's piece on proposals to send more Britons into space - watch it here - it was suggested that there hadn't been any Belgian astronauts. </unknownNode><unknownNode>However, as viewer Danny noted, Belgium has had not one, but two men in space. The first was Dirk Frimout way back in 1992, who flew as a payload specialist aboard the Space Shuttle Atlantis. </unknownNode><unknownNode>An unsourced note on his wikipaedia entry claims he sparked "Frimout-mania" on his return to Belgium and spoke with Prince Philippe whilst aboard Atlantis. We can't confirm the extent of Frimout-mania but we'd love to hear of any examples. We did find this apparent homage on YouTube - La danse du Dirk Frimout.</unknownNode><unknownNode>The second Belgian in space was Frank De Winne, who flew as a member of a Russian Soyuz programme in 2002, and is due to fly again on another Soyuz mission to the International Space Station in 2009.</unknownNode><unknownNode>So apologies to Belgium and its astronauts and all its space enthusiasts.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Dear viewers, </unknownNode><unknownNode>George W Bush We kick off tonight with the first interview for the BBC with George W Bush in many a long year. He heads to Africa tomorrow and has given BBC America's Matt Frei an eve-of-visit interview. Sudan - and Steven Spielberg's resignation from the Beijing Olympic ceremony - will be at the top the agenda, but he was also asked about Iraq and his legacy at home and abroad. Watch the interview here.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Kosovo From Kosovo we'll have a film from the BBC&rsquo;s Allan Little, who was there during the conflict and in Bosnia before that. It is now almost certain that the Kosovan Albanian leadership will declare independence this weekend - a position supported by the US. After that Northern Kosovo, almost entirely populated by Serbs, may declare independence, followed by the Serbs in Bosnia - it is believed land swaps are already being arranged. Will this be tantamount to permanent partition and what are the implications for the region? </unknownNode><unknownNode>Raissi Lotfi Raissi, wrongly accused of training pilots involved in 9/11, should be allowed to claim compensation the court of appeal ruled this morning. The judgement was very critical of the Crown Prosecution Service and the Home Office for granting an extradition request from the Americans. He will be live on Newsnight tonight. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Brits in Space? ...and what has Space exploration done for us? A revolution in communications for one thing, but today as the Government launches its new Space Strategy is there a danger we are going to hitch our wagon to Nasa and manned flights, rather than take a more imaginative route to new frontiers?</unknownNode><unknownNode>I hope you'll be on board tonight Kirsty </unknownNode><unknownNode>Classical improvisation was a serious art for masters such as Beethoven and Liszt, and Venezuelan pianist Gabriela Montero is fast proving it is not a lost art.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Montero can take whatever suggestions she is given and turn them into fully formed compositions, drawing on jazz, tango and even blues. </unknownNode><unknownNode>For Newsnight, she has set herself a challenge: on Tuesday's programme Gabriela will perform an improvised live piece based on your suggestions.</unknownNode><unknownNode>In the past she has improvised around classical works from Vivaldi, crossed Bizet with Scott Joplin and played Bach in the style of Italian pianist Busoni. Her repertoire also includes more eclectic inspirations - the Archers theme tune, Gloria Gaynor's I Will Survive, Christmas carols and even football chants have been woven into pieces. She is also happy to use abstract themes - weather, moods, seasons - as leitmotifs. Listen to Gabriela&rsquo;s take on Vivaldi&rsquo;s Summer and Winter (courtesy of EMI Classics)</unknownNode><unknownNode>Below are the suggestions you sent for Gabriela to improvise around - but which one will we choose? Watch Newsnight on Tuesday to find out...</unknownNode><unknownNode>Dan Kelly is today's programme producer - here is his early email to the production team. But what do you want to see covered?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Good morning. Happy Valentine&rsquo;s Day.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Matt Frei has an interview with George W Bush  - the first BBC interview for many years. The pitch for the interview was to speak about Africa on the eve of Bush's trip there - fortunately for us Darfur, and the role of China in Sudan has become a very big issue this week.  We could do a discussion off the back - who would you like on? </unknownNode><unknownNode>Lotfi Raissi, wrongly accused of training pilots involved in 9/11, should be allowed to claim compensation the Court of Appeal ruled this morning. The judgement was very critical of the CPS and the Home Office for granting an extradition request from the Americans.</unknownNode><unknownNode>A review into Britain's space programme is launched today - and the prospect of a British manned mission is now very real. Is this the right direction, or a huge waste of money? Which guests could we get on? </unknownNode><unknownNode>We have a film from Kosovo by Allan Little, ahead of the expected declaration of independence this weekend.</unknownNode><unknownNode>We should keep an eye on Beirut. What else have you seen? What guests would you like to see on?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Dan</unknownNode><unknownNode>Mysterious death of Georgian billionaire</unknownNode><unknownNode>A billionaire and opposition leader from the former Soviet state of Georgia was found dead in his home in Surrey last night. He'd been accused of trying to foment a coup in his native country, and just weeks ago, he claimed that the authorities in Georgia wanted him dead. Surrey police are treating his death as suspicious. It&rsquo;s possible they will conclude that Badri Patarkatsishvili  died of a simple heart attack. But why did he believe his life was in danger? We're investigating.</unknownNode><unknownNode> Is China fit to host the Olympics?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Steven Spielberg has decided to quit as artistic adviser to the Beijing Olympics because of China's relationship with Sudan. Human rights groups have wasted no time in reminding the world of a host of other reasons why China's fitness to hold the Olympics is questionable. Should multi-million dollar sponsors of the games follow Spielberg's lead? Or is engagement with China the right way forward?</unknownNode><unknownNode> BAe</unknownNode><unknownNode>A judicial review of the Serious Fraud Office's decision to halt the inquiry in to BAe's relationship with Saudi Arabia is due to start tomorrow. Newsnight will be analysing some of the documents that are likely to form a key part of the court case. They suggest that there was considerable political pressure for the inquiry to be halted a long time before it was.</unknownNode><unknownNode> Culture in schools </unknownNode><unknownNode>School children in England will be offered five hours of cultural activities  a week, we learnt today. Is the government right to set store by such forms of learning? And why has it not been a priority until now? A top scientist and the musician Nitin Sawnhey will join Jeremy. </unknownNode><unknownNode>At the beginning of this week we launched a new feature on the website - Newsnight gold.</unknownNode><unknownNode>From down in the depths of the Newsnight archive (actually it's upstairs), librarian Adam will unearth the best of Newsnights gone by. We have mined the archive before for our 25th anniversary back in 2005 - but now Adam will bring us highlights from corresponding weeks from past years (you'll have to wait until October for his favourite piece - voodoo in Haiti from 1981).</unknownNode><unknownNode>His first find is from 12 February, 1980 - the programme's first year on-air. Charles Wheeler reports from Maine on a fractious Democratic presidential nomination campaign (sound familiar?). Watch it here.</unknownNode><unknownNode>We've included the titles and an "And finally..." story so you can see the set and graphics in their full glory. As you can see, much has changed in television news... Do let us know your thoughts.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Liz Gibbons is today's programme producer - here is her early email to the team.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Hi - what do you want to cover tonight?</unknownNode><unknownNode>I'm interested in the IPPR commission on national security - is the terror threat in danger of concealing more fundamental and pressing issues?  We could have a grand discussion.</unknownNode><unknownNode>China and Spielberg is good too - how could we move it on and who could we hear from?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Culture in schools - clearly a good talking point.

Government political advisers are putting out feelers for jobs in the private sector.  Left-leaning think tanks, lobbyists and PR firms who&rsquo;ve all thrived in the years of New Labour, are starting to re-orientate themselves, trying to recruit more staff with Conservative backgrounds, all in readiness for the day they will have to prove their worth under a Cameron regime, and show strong personal links with his likely team of ministers.</unknownNode><unknownNode>But personally I am far from convinced that David Cameron will emerge from the next election as Prime Minister &ndash; if you put a gun to my head I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s still only 50-50.  Despite Gordon Brown&rsquo;s troubles (and continuing gloom in the Labour ranks), I know that many leading Conservatives privately share my doubts about their prospects.</unknownNode><unknownNode>It&rsquo;s that 2008 doesn&rsquo;t yet have the feel of the years 1994 to 1997, when the newly elected Tony Blair inspired a genuine popular enthusiasm for New Labour, which by 1996 became a widespread assumption that Labour would return to power.  Whilst many of the public have severe doubts about Gordon Brown and the Labour government, they aren&rsquo;t yet convinced that David Cameron is the answer, or has the answers.</unknownNode><unknownNode>And whilst the Tories are ahead in the polls, they aren&rsquo;t yet matching Tony Blair&rsquo;s huge double-digit (often more than 20 per cent) leads of the mid-1990s.  And remember the huge bias in the electoral system which means (depending on which analysis you trust) the Conservatives have to get between six and ten per cent head of Labour simply to win an equal number of seats.</unknownNode><unknownNode>To persuade me that David Cameron is on his way to Downing Street let me pose three tests.</unknownNode><unknownNode> 						Continue reading "Three key tests for David Cameron" 					</unknownNode><unknownNode>The Archbishop of Canterbury has attracted widespread criticism after appearing to back the adoption of some aspects of Sharia law in the UK. Dr Rowan Williams said the UK had to "face up to the fact" some citizens did not relate to the UK legal system.  Culture Secretary Andy Burnham said such moves would create "social chaos&rdquo;. But Bishop of Hulme, the Rt Rev Stephen Lowe, criticised the "disgraceful" way in which the archbishop had been "ridiculed" and "lampooned" by some.</unknownNode><unknownNode>We'll be devoting the whole of the programme tonight to the main issues surrounding this story.

Some senior Anglican priests have defended his remarks - saying Dr Rowan Williams was talking about decisions relating to marriage and property, not crimes or questions of belief.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Has the response to the Archbishop's comments been Islamophobic or does this pose a genuine threat to British culture?</unknownNode><unknownNode>We'll discuss the issues on the programme tonight - leave your thoughts below.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Sharia law in the UK? Is this what we really want? The Archbishop of Canterbury - leader of the Church of England - thinks it is unavoidable, and desirable. He told the The World at One on Radio 4, "There's a place for finding what would be a constructive accommodation with some aspects of Muslim law, as we already do with some other aspects of religious law."  He specified marital disputes and financial disputes and not the "inhumanity" that has sometimes been associated with the practice of the law in some Islamic states. </unknownNode><unknownNode>But is this really the way to achieve "social cohesion" and has he consulted, in particular, British Muslim women for their views on this? Tonight Newsnight discusses how Sharia would work given equal status to English and Scottish Law, and if Sharia is a legal system you can "pick and choose".   Ken Livingstone Ken Livingstone appeared before the London Assembly today and Michael Crick was watching. The mayor&rsquo;s stewardship of London is under question tonight. There have been calls for the resignation of his close friend and race advisor Lee Jasper. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Emails released by the London Development Agency allegedly show that 13 projects in the city run by Mr Jasper or his friends received as much as &pound;3.3m without proper process.

Then you&rsquo;ve got policies that don&rsquo;t make sense but which are popular, and then there are policies which make sense but are unpopular. The worst of all are policies like this - which are neither sensible nor popular.&rdquo;</unknownNode><unknownNode>I went to a hearing of the Information Tribunal this morning where the Freedom of Information campaigner Heather Brooke and a couple of Sunday newspaper journalists were trying to get the House of Commons authorities to release more details about what MPs can claim on their additional costs allowance.</unknownNode><unknownNode>This is the money they get for having to occupy a second home, either in London or in their constituencies. They are reimbursed not just for rental or mortgage interest costs on their second home but also a general household expenditure, including items of furniture.</unknownNode><unknownNode>We heard from Andrew Walker, Director General of Finance and Administration, who argued that providing more detail would be an invasion of MPs personal privacy.</unknownNode><unknownNode>A well known Oxford Street store will no doubt be delighted to learn that that the Commons finance department keeps what Mr Walker calls a &ldquo;John Lewis list&rdquo; of reasonably priced items. TV sets for instance, which are neither luxury/top of the range nor &ldquo;the bottom end of the market&rdquo;.</unknownNode><unknownNode>So Mr Walker&rsquo;s department would be unlikely to accept a claim for a plasma TV, he told the tribunal, and claims for iPods are rejected on the grounds that iPods are regarded as a personal items, but he said fish tanks &ldquo;may be claimable&rdquo;. Although he did know of one case where a claim for a fish tank had been rejected.</unknownNode><unknownNode>If only the BBC accounts were as understanding as this.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Simon Enright is today's programme producer - here is his early email to the team.

The US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice met the prime minister in London today to discuss strategy in Afghanistan. British Generals are calling for troop reinforcements, meanwhile the US Defence Secretary Robert Gates was scathing about the ability and willingness of NATO members, other than the US and Britain, to put up forces for Afghanistan. So who is prepared to send more troops to Afghanistan? Mark Urban has been investigating.</unknownNode><unknownNode>US elections Gavin has moved from New York to Washington, and will be picking over the results of yesterday's "Super Tuesday" primaries.  Results are still coming in, but it looks as if John McCain now has an unassailable lead in the Republican race. Gavin has been looking at Senator McCain's Presidential credentials - what is it about the 71 year old who is at odds with his party on many of the key issues that has allowed him to do so well? And what of this talk of a deal with his rival for the nomination - Mike Huckabee? </unknownNode><unknownNode>On the Democrat side - it's looking much tighter. Barack Obama won more states than Hillary Clinton in last night's contest, but they are almost neck-and-neck in the race for delegates. It's possible that no clear winner will emerge until the party convention in August. David Grossman is in California and will be asking when the race for the White House will become clear cut. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Intercept evidence Meanwhile there seems to be political consensus that the law should be changed so that intercept evidence can be used, in certain circumstances, in courts. But what do the security services make of the government's announcement today? Richard Watson has been investigating.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Shy Keenan And the story of Shy Keenan's campaign for justice. She was raped and sexually abused by a series of men led by her stepfather from the age of three until she was 14. As a young woman she repeatedly tried to get the authorities to listen to her horrific story, but it was not until she worked with Newsnight on a special investigation into her abuse that she was able to confront her stepfather and secretly film him admitting it. He and two other men were then jailed for a total of 32 years. Since the conviction she has campaigned for the child victims of sexual abuse, and tomorrow her account of her destroyed childhood and the long road to a recovered life will be published - read an extract. She will be live tonight on the programme.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Shy Keenan was systematically raped by her stepfather Stanley Claridge throughout her childhood. When she was just ten she was almost killed by a group of abusers he had sold her to. In a Newsnight special investigation in 2000, she secretly recorded Stanley Claridge admitting the abuse &ndash; an admission that led to him and his accomplices being arrested and brought to trial. Shy Keenan&rsquo;s testimony ensured he and two other men were imprisoned. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Founder - with Sara Payne &ndash; of Phoenix Survivors, Shy Keenan now campaigns for justice for victims of childhood sexual abuse. Her book Broken is her story - of how she survived being abused and fought to bring those responsible to justice. The following extract is from chapter 30, Why Me?, which details the trial.</unknownNode><unknownNode>BROKEN by Shy Keenan is published by Hodder &amp; Stoughton in hardcover (&pound;12.99) on 7 February </unknownNode><unknownNode> 						Continue reading "Newsnight book club: Broken by Shy Keenan" 					</unknownNode><unknownNode>First, the use of the term &ldquo;middle class voters&rdquo;. The trouble is that &ldquo;middle class&rdquo; in America means a very different group of people to the British &ldquo;middle class&rdquo;. In the USA &ldquo;middle class&rdquo; essentially means &ldquo;middle income&rdquo; &ndash; the average Joe &ndash; people we in Britain might term &ldquo;lower middle class&rdquo; or &ldquo;upper working class&rdquo;. But the &ldquo;middle class&rdquo; in Britain are essentially the top half of the population - the better off, people in professional jobs, who own their own homes and so on. This difference explains why American politicians, Democrat and Republican, frequently win cheers for saying &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve got to do more for middle class voters&rdquo;, whereas any politician who said that in Britain would be taking a huge risk. They would be condemned as elitist, and accused of neglecting the less well-off. So talking of "middle class" people in the the American context becomes confusing and meaningless for a British audience. It's better, if talking of the American "middle class", to use the term "middle income".</unknownNode><unknownNode>Second, can we please stop referring to Hillary Clinton merely as &ldquo;Hillary&rdquo;? Calling politicians by their Christian names implies an element of favour or intimacy. It&rsquo;s dangerous and should always be avoided by independent journalists and especially broadcasters.  Would we have called the 1980 presidential race a contest between Jimmy Carter and Ronnie? Of course not. OK, one needs to distinguish Hillary Clinton from her husband, so she should be called &ldquo;Hillary Clinton&rdquo; or &ldquo;Mrs Clinton&rdquo;. And the same argument applies to the Labour and Conservative contenders in the current London mayoral election, who are often referred to in the media as &ldquo;Ken&rdquo; (Livingstone) and &ldquo;Boris&rdquo; (Johnson). It&rsquo;s terribly unfair on the Liberal Democrat Brian Paddick and all the other candidates.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Today's programme producer is Carol Rubra - here is her early email to the production team.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Super Tuesday We'll spend a chunk of the programme looking at what happened on Super Tuesday. Gavin will co-present from Washington, Kirsty is here, while David and Ben are in LA (watch David's latest videoblog on the Newsnight US election website).  We have a pre-recorded interview with Stan Greenberg and a live discussion. </unknownNode><unknownNode>But there are other stories around too. Let's talk in the meeting about which we should do and how:  Afghanistan - a "critical week" with more troops being announced today and new figures on the opium trade; Intercept evidence to be used in trials; Proposals to change law on under-age drinking in public places; PMQs; and we have an interview with Shy Keenan.</unknownNode><unknownNode>What would you like to see on the programme?</unknownNode><unknownNode>SUPER DUPER TUESDAY Hello to viewers. We open tonight with Gavin in New York and David Grossman watching the political drama unfold - in what one US journalist called Super complicated Tuesday.  It's a key date in the American Presidential contest. Republicans and Democrats in 24 states - almost half the country, are choosing their candidates in the race for the White House. Eventually, it could mean the United States getting either its first woman President, its first black President, or its oldest incoming President.  The story will be unfolding while we're on air and we will be there live.    BUGGING Then on this side of the Atlantic, is surveillance growing unchecked, and without us really having any idea who is authorising bugging and intercepts, and therefore operating with little or no accountability? Is it a frightening or reassuring prospect that someone may be watching us, and is the threat of terror a legitimate reason for surveillance or an excuse for breaching our human rights? The bugging of the civil rights lawyer, MP and now government minister Sadiq Khan on visits to his constituent and client Babar Ahmad in Woodhill Prison has become a major political and security row. Tonight we'll be exploring the limits of freedom, and the role of the State.   KITE FLYING Also tonight, is kite flying a sound political tool, a legitimate vehicle of gauging public opinion or a cheap way of scoring political points? Today in her first speech as Housing Minister Caroline Flint suggested that in order to qualify for council housing people would have to show a willingness to work. She was immediately condemned by some charities for suggesting &ldquo;a return to the workhouse". This follows David Cameron's uncosted idea that all new mothers should have a home nurse for a baby&rsquo;s first week. We explore the modern history of political kite flying - some of the soaring successes and plummeting failures.</unknownNode><unknownNode> </unknownNode><unknownNode>Robert Morgan is today's programme producer. Here's his early email to the production team.  Good morning everyone,</unknownNode><unknownNode>It's Super Duper Tuesday. Gavin, Liz and Lucy are in New York. David and Ben are in LA. We'll be doing a co-pres with Kirsty here. A lot of the production work will need to be done here. I'll explain more in the meeting. Other stories include new lines in the extraordinary bugging story, Northern Rock, housing, and Prince Andrew. Do come to the meeting with ideas on how to do these stories and any others you like.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Robert  </unknownNode><unknownNode>Here's Newsnight's latest list of MPs who employ members of their families, or have done so recently.  Our named total is now 96, though we know the overall figure is probably around 200, maybe more.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>David Cameron said on Friday that more than 70 Conservative MPs employ relatives.  Nick Clegg has said there are around 12 Lib Dems.  Labour has yet to give us an official number but "sources" say today their "best guess is between 90 and 100".</unknownNode><unknownNode>So to add to our initial list of 79 - already supplemented by Martin Caton and the Speaker Michael Martin - we can now add the following 15:</unknownNode><unknownNode>Peter Atkinson  Julian Brazier Janet Dean Nadine Dorries Sharon Hodgson  Phil Hope Lindsay Hoyle Chris McCafferty  Denis Murphy Bill Olner  John Pugh  Laurence Robertson Geraldine Smith  Bob Spink Hugo Swire</unknownNode><unknownNode>I don't think so. The Treasury said today that any private sector solution to Northern Rock has to offer the taxpayer a "demonstrably better" outcome than any nationalisation. Let's be clear, (as I always say to finance geeks "as if for an idot") what the economic stakes are: - Northern Rock owes the government 24bn pounds it can't pay back...</unknownNode><unknownNode> 						Continue reading "Are the two remaining Northern Rock bids enough to stave off nationalisation?" 					</unknownNode><unknownNode>Dear reader and viewer,</unknownNode><unknownNode>Tonight Jeremy Paxman is down at the House of Commons asking honourable members whether they still deserve the privileges that being an MP brings. We'll have his report and debate the issue.</unknownNode><unknownNode>That on the day the Commons Speaker Michael Martin admits there is deep concern about MPs&rsquo; expenses and convenes his committee to draw up new rules. Michael Crick is asking the questions about MPs and their financial rewards.</unknownNode><unknownNode>We'll also be asking just how widespread bugging of Parliamentarians is these days - this weekend we heard from Sadiq Khan MP who was bugged while visiting a constituent in prison. Another politician who claims he's been bugged speaks to us.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Just south of Baghdad today the Americans have killed up to 20 civilians - including children. A dreadful mistake at a time when, mostly, events on the ground were improving. Our correspondent Jonny Dymond reports on how despite awful mistakes like today's, the troops are changing hearts and minds. But will it be a permanent shift? More from Jonny on his time with US troops here.</unknownNode><unknownNode>And Gavin Esler is in the States ahead of tomorrow's crucial vote dubbed Super Tuesday. Obama, Hillary, McCain, Romney or even Huckabee? Who will emerge as victors and will it finally mean we know who will be running for President for the Republicans and the Democrats? Watch David Grossman's videoblog and lots more Newsnight US election coverage here.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Simon Enright, programme producer</unknownNode><unknownNode>Simon Enright is today's programme producer. Here's his early email to the production team. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Lots we could do today. If we are going to do it properly what should we choose?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Of course we'll preview Super Tuesday - or Super Dooper Tuesday as they keep calling it. Gavin is in Washington and David Grossman is in Arizona. David's latest video blog will appear on the US elections page very shortly.</unknownNode><unknownNode>But that is not our lead story. Should that be:</unknownNode><unknownNode>Bugging - It appears that the so-called "Wilson Doctrine" has been broken. An MP bugged whilst visiting a constituent - admittedly a constituent being held in prison as he awaits extradition ruling on terrorist charges in the States. Is the Wilson Doctrine out of date or should we be outraged by this casual bugging of our MPs?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Northern Rock - We get final confirmation of bidders today. But is there something deeply unfair to the rest of the banking industry in all this?</unknownNode><unknownNode>GPs - What is the battle between the BMA and government all about and what do GPs and patients really want?</unknownNode><unknownNode>MPs Expenses - Now the Inland Revenue is going to get involved. Is there more that we should be doing?</unknownNode><unknownNode>There are other news stories around. Do let me know which ones you think could work as well.</unknownNode><unknownNode>It&rsquo;s nice to see that all three of the major party leaders now seem to be adopting a proposal I made more than four years ago to the then Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, Sir Philip Mawer &ndash; that MPs should have to state of the Register of MPs Interests if they employ any members of their families.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>I made the proposal in the autumn of 2003, during the so-called Betsygate episode, when I passed on to Sir Philip serious allegations I had received form senior Tories to the effect that the former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith was employing his wife Betsy as his secretary, and paying her from his Parliamentary allowances, but, it was alleged to me, she was doing little or no work.  After a long and extensive enquiry the allegations were dismissed, and Sir Philip concluded that Mrs Duncan Smith had in fact been working for her husband on parliamentary business.</unknownNode><unknownNode>I made my proposal for greater disclosure because I suspected &ndash; despite the judgement on IDS &ndash; that there was a significant amount of abuse by MPs in this area.  If MPs had to say publicly if they were employing their spouses, children and so on, then, I reckoned, they might think twice about allowing them to do little or no work.  Other people have gone further than me, arguing that MPs ought to declare the names of all staff employed from public funds.</unknownNode><unknownNode>My suggestion was roundly ignored &ndash; by Sir Philip, by the Standards and Privileges Committee, by the Speaker and the Parliamentary authorities, by the media, and by MPs and the political parties.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Now, with today&rsquo;s scramble by the party leaders to outdo each other in transparency on all this, I am having to revise again the number of MPs who were employing family members.  On Wednesday night I said it could be up to a hundred.  Last night, when Newsnight published its list of 79 names, I said it was probably well over a hundred.  But on today&rsquo;s evidence it looks like it could easily be as many as 250.  David Cameron has said the Conservatives now reckon more than 70 of their 193 MPs employ family members &ndash; almost 40 per cent - while Nick Clegg says there are at least twelve Lib Dems.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>Newsnight&rsquo;s list of 79 names has now crept up to 81, with the addition of Martin Caton, and the Speaker Michael Martin, who employs his daughter Mary on a part-time basis.  Of our 81 names, 47 are Labour, 25 Conservative, 8 Lib Dems, plus the Speaker.  And given the figures David Cameron and Nick Clegg have produced today, we can calculate that the very minimum number of MPs who employ family members is now 140.  It doesn&rsquo;t seem unreasonable to think the Labour total could eventually climb from 47 to 150, hence my new estimate of around 250.</unknownNode><unknownNode>David Cameron says the Conservative front bench will all have to declare the own circumstances on this by 1 April.  Fine &ndash; but why wait two months?  Why not tell by 12 noon on Monday?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Today's Quote for the Day "That image of myself soused in champagne being devoured by lusting women in a luxury hotel suite was the pinnacle of my rock and roll excesses.

After conversations with MPs today I'm inclined to think the total number employing relatives could be well over 100.  Of course the vast majority of these MPs will be employing their relatives quite legitimately, and they will deserve every penny they get, if not more.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Nick Ainger  Kevin Barron  Margaret Beckett  Sir Stuart Bell  Hilary Benn  Sir Paul Beresford  Colin Breed  Malcolm Bruce  Angela Browning  Alistair Burt  Lorely Burt  Dawn Butler  Sir Menzies Campbell  Christopher Chope  Michael Clapham  Paul Clark  David Clelland  Derek Conway  David Crausby  Ian Davidson  Philip Davies  Quentin Davies  David Davis  Jim Dobbin  Jeff Ennis  Mark Fisher Caroline Flint  Hywel Francis  Roger Gale  Ian Gibson  Linda Gilroy  Chris Grayling  Peter Hain  Mike Hall  David Hamilton  Stephen Hammond  Tom Harris  Oliver Heald  David Heath  Kelvin Hopkins  Eric Illsley  Alan Keen  Stephen Ladyman  Bob Laxton  Edward Leigh  Tom Levitt  Ian Liddell-Grainger  Martin Linton Peter Luff  Andrew MacKinlay  Eric Martlew  Sarah McCarthy-Fry  Tommy McAvoy  Patrick McLoughlin  Andrew Miller  Michael Moore 	 Malcolm Moss  Albert Owen  Owen Patterson  Mike Penning  Mark Pritchard  John Redwood  Linda Riordan   Dan Rogerson  Adrian Sanders  Jim Sheridan  Andrew Smith  Angela Smith  Sir Peter Soulsby  Anthony Steen  Howard Stoate  Gary Streeter  Desmond Swayne  Mark Tami  Dari Taylor  Ben Wallace  Alan Williams  Iain Wright  Sir George Young </unknownNode><unknownNode>GREEN GORDON?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Is Gordon as green as he paints himself? If he is, why is the government apparently letting an application for a new coal-fired power station go through without any commitment to carbon capture and storage?   The new plant which is to be built by E.ON UK at Kingsnorth in Kent will make it harder for the UK to meet its carbon reduction targets. The Conservatives are calling for carbon capture and storage technology to be applied from the outset - but according to e-mails given to Newsnight the government isn't even going to insist that the power plant is ready to fit such technology when it is available.</unknownNode><unknownNode>AFGHANISTAN   What is happening to President Hamid Karzai's leadership of Afghanistan? The amount of land under opium in Afghanistan is more than under coca cultivation in Columbia, Bolivia and Peru combined.  Afghan MP Malalai Joya writes in today's Independent that the government is as bad as the Taliban, with more women killing themselves in the country in 2007 than ever before.  So why did President Karzai "veto" Paddy Ashdown as a "super envoy" to Afghanistan, and earlier in Davos say that the British presence in Helmand had made things worse? Is he angry that the international community has not delivered the reconstruction aid it promised,  and, worried about his own re-election, trying to court votes with a more belligerent attitude to the West?  Mark Urban assesses the man once seen as the saving grace of Afghanistan.</unknownNode><unknownNode> CANNABIS   Should cannabis be reclassified from C to B? It was only four years ago that the rules on the drug were relaxed. This morning the Rowntree Foundation published its report which insists that making possession a more serious offence will have no impact whatsoever. The police take the opposite view.  Who's right?   And Michael Crick is still on the case of the Conway family affair at Westminster.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Much speculation at Westminster over how the Sunday Times originally managed to finger Derek Conway in the first place. Their original article, on 27 May 2007, not only specified how much he was paying his son Freddie, but also managed to quote how much three other MPs were paying their wives to work as staff - Malcolm Bruce, Nick Ainger and Sir Stuart Bell.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Many Tory MPs think the Sunday Times must have had a mole inside the Fees Office, the Commons department which pays MPs staff. But there's another theory. Notice that the four MPs named by the Sunday Times had names starting with A, B or C? Perhaps someone in the Fees Office simply left a sheet of paper of MPs 'A to C' on a photocopier, or some similar mishap.  Stranger things have happened.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Jeremy Paxman was sceptical last night about my suggestion on the programme that as many as 100 MPs could be employing relatives of one kind or another. The Daily Mail has a list today of 63 who do so, and just from memory I can add three others. So my estimate of up to 100 in all may not be as ludicrous as Jeremy seemed to think.  A Sunday newspaper is doing a big survey, and the Tory whips have told their MPs to cooperate, so we may get a better picture this weekend.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Today's prgramme producer is Simon Enright - here is his early email to the production team.

That's one of the questions thrown up by the case of the Conservative MP Derek Conway.

Mr Conway paid one of his sons more than &pound;45,000 to be his researcher - though there was no evidence that he did any work.

Last week we asked her to report for us on how Kenya, seemingly such a stable country, could face such violence after December's troubled elections. Karen was filming at the weekend just as the violence flared again. It makes a depressing, but we think important film to watch. ( Watch Paul Mason's recent Newsnight reports from Nairobi)</unknownNode><unknownNode>Secret trials Author Allan Chappelow was murdered just over a year ago - found dead in his own home underneath copies of one his own books about George Bernard Shaw. This week a man will stand trial for his murder. But much of the evidence will be held in secret for issues of national security. It is a very unusual thing to happen - and a very odd case too - we'll debate whether it is ever right for trials to be held in secret in this way.</unknownNode><unknownNode>State of the Union Odd to think it but tonight George Bush will give his last State of the Union speech to the American people.

But Stephanie Flanders will explain why most EU countries also have the fiscal resources to buy their way out of recession but that, despite all Gordon Brown's talk of prudence, Alistair Darling does not.</unknownNode><unknownNode>NHS wards Finally it has been a major commitment of Labour Party manifesto's since even before Tony Blair was elected - an end to mixed sex wards. Today in the Lords, the surgeon and health minister Lord Darzi admitted that single sex wards in the NHS is "an aspiration that cannot be met". We'll be asking why the government's given up on such a long held commitment.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Simon Enright</unknownNode><unknownNode>The case of Derek Conway, the Conservative MP who has been reprimanded by the Commons Standards Committee for employing his son from the MP&rsquo;s Parliamentary staffing allowance, highlights a problem I&rsquo;ve been banging on about for several years.</unknownNode><unknownNode>When I last checked about three years ago, there were around 60 MPs - almost ten per cent of the total - who employed staff with the same surname. Now they won&rsquo;t all have been family members and there would have been the odd coincidence of name, but the vast majority of them would have been wives, sons, sisters and so on.  On top of that there will be many other MPs who employ members of their families with different surnames.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Now I&rsquo;m not saying all these MPs are corrupt.  Far from it.  There are many MPs spouses who do a good job for them, and deserve every penny they are paid from public funds (and probably a lot  more). The late Eric Heffer MP was always shadowed by his wife and parliamentary secretary Doris Heffer. According to the diaries of Giles Radice, Doris Heffer would sit in the front row of the audience when Heffer was speaking, saying "nonsense, Eric" if he said something with which she disagreed. A similar supporting role was provided to Brian Sedgemore, who late in his career defected from Labour to the Liberal Democrats. In his case, it wasn't 'the wife' who worked for him, but rather, 'the ex-wife', continuing her duties even after they had divorced.</unknownNode><unknownNode>But almost everyone at Westminster knows there is significant abuse of the system.  They know there are many MPs who pay staffing allowances to relatives in return for little or no work, as seems to have happened with Derek Conway and his son.  And the big increases in MPs staffing allowances in recent years have probably made the abuse more prevalent, enabling MPs to have enough funds to employ a genuine secretary and/or researcher at the same time as also funnelling money to a relative who does little or no work for their money.</unknownNode><unknownNode>I&rsquo;m not saying MPs should be banned from employing relatives, a rule they have in the German Parliament, and the US Senate. In many cases it makes a lot of sense, and given MPs gruelling schedules, it may do a lot to keep some of their marriages going.  But at the very least there should be a public record of which MPs employ relatives from public funds.  But attempts I&rsquo;ve made to secure such information through Freedom of Information requests have met with the response from the Westminster authorities that it can&rsquo;t be provided to me for reasons of privacy and security reasons.  Oh yeah!</unknownNode><unknownNode>Overall, British politics may be dogged by regular sleaze stories, but in reality there are few examples where I can think of British politicians abusing their positions for personal financial gain (as opposed to political gain). The employment by certain MPs of relatives who do little or no work is one big exception to this. The Parliamentary authorities should be more vigilant in putting a stop to it. An additional section in the Register of Members Interests on the employment of family members might help, causing MPs to think twice about whom they employ.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Today's prgramme producer is Simon Enright - here is his early email to the production team.

It must surely be hugely disruptive to the working of government when several ministers like these in complicated and sensitive jobs are only in post for seven months before they move on.  It would have been far simpler surely, to promote Caroline Flint from minister of state at the department of Work and Pensions into the Secretary of State&rsquo;s job and leave Purnell, Burnham and Cooper in their existing positions.  By my reckoning Yvette Cooper is the ninth person to serve as Chief Secretary in less than eleven years of Labour government (Alistair Darling, Stephen Byers, Alan Milburn, Andrew Smith, Paul Boateng, Des Browne, Stephen Timms and Andy Burnham being her predecessors).</unknownNode><unknownNode>Now with Ed Balls and Yvette Cooper we have the first married couple in a British cabinet in British history, though not, I suspect, the first lovers (suggestions anyone?).  It would be interesting to know, though, how they will handle things when Balls goes to see his wife to negotiate future schools budgets.    </unknownNode><unknownNode>The resignation of Bruce Grocott as government whip in the Lords sees the departure from government of probably the last remaining link with the Wilson government, since Grocott first acted as a ministerial PPS in 1975.  More significant, Brown loses an experienced, battle-hardened figure who played an important role at the heart of the Blair regime (as Blair&rsquo;s PPS).  His replacement as Lords whip, Jan Royall was once extremely close to Neil Kinnock, having worked as his secretary and adviser for almost twenty years, in both Westminster and Brussels.  More recently she was a key figure in the Brown leadership campaign, and I recall her at one campaign event fulfilling the rather unseemly task (for a member of the Lords, I felt), of kneeling on the ground, arms out-stretched, trying to hold back the pressure of reporters and cameramen. </unknownNode><unknownNode>In Peter Hain, the Cabinet has undoubtedly lost one of its more colourful figures.  Hain has been a famous face for almost four decades, longer than anyone in government.  He first made his name, barely out of his teens, with his chairmanship of the anti-apartheid campaign, which successfully blocked the 1970 South African test tour, sparking the famous headline &lsquo;Hain Stops Play&rsquo;.  He&rsquo;s one of the few Cabinet ministers to have written any books, and his long list of works even includes a novel &ndash; The Peking Connection - though I&rsquo;ve yet to read it.  (The only other ministerial novelist I know of is the Justice Minister Michael Wills, who&rsquo;s recently published a couple of thrillers under the pseudonym David Mckeowen).    </unknownNode><unknownNode>True, Hain had been greatly weakened politically by his poor showing in the deputy leadership contest, and by the subsequent furore of his donations, but he was one of independent voices in government, occasionally willing to show dissent with one or another aspect of government policy.  He was one of the few people round Gordon Brown&rsquo;s cabinet table whom I could imagine arguing with the Prime Minister or being willing to tell Brown when he was wrong.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>With James Purnell (37), Andy Burnham (38), Yvette Cooper (38), Ed Miliband (38) and Ruth Kelly (39), the Cabinet now has five members under the age of 40, and two others, Douglas Alexander and Ed Balls who are only 40, making it surely the most youthful cabinet in modern times.  OK, it makes the government look youthful and fresh, and these are all highly intelligent and able individuals, but what Gordon Brown badly needs are more wise old greybeards who have a bit more experience of real life than political advisers have.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>People, in fact, like Peter Hain and Bruce Grocott.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Watch Newsnight coverage of Peter Hain's resignation on the Big Fat Newsnight Politics Page.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Today's Quote for the Day:  "This is just bad luck, it's Murphy's Law.

One rogue trader and France's second biggest bank, Societe Generale is down at least &pound;3.5 billion. And this was purportedly a junior banker.

Please have a think about a big issue we could take on.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Or</unknownNode><unknownNode>Today the European Union is announcing its energy strategy. It will include a 20% target for energy produced from renewables by 2020, and details of how the new Emissions Trading Scheme will work. Countries will be required to auction some of the permits which have previously been free and many are concerned that this will have an impact on how competitive European businesses will be able to be. As we enter a period of global economic instability, and concern about the increased economic power of China and India is this a dangerous moment to be inflicting such tough targets on business, but then again can we afford the damage to the planet if we fail to cut emissions? Which interesting speakers should we try and get in the studio for a discussion on growth v dealing with climate change?</unknownNode><unknownNode>We also have a film about how on the 75th anniversary of the Courtauld Institute, they are reappraising the complicated figure, of Anthony Blunt, who made the Institute what it is. He lectured there from the beginning but his role as inspirational art historian has been fudged until now, upstaged by his other, more controversial activities.</unknownNode><unknownNode>What other stories should we be doing? And how we can put our own stamp on it?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Faith schools - in an interview David Cameron implies that parents who "find faith" to get their children into the right schools are good members of society. Knife crime and youth crime - ACPO are announcing their strategy to deal with huge increases in these crimes tomorrow. Gaza Peter Hain Police march on pay Supercasinos Or something completely different?   Carol </unknownNode><unknownNode>I know we're supposed not to be partisan, or to pass judgement on those we interview. </unknownNode><unknownNode>But I have to say that of all the many politicians it has been my (occasionally painful) duty to interview over the years, Mr Bondevik comes pretty near the top. ( Watch it here.)</unknownNode><unknownNode>It's so rare to find man talking with such frankness and courage about such a charged and sensitive subject.</unknownNode><unknownNode>For some reason, mental ill-health retains an aura, which seems at times to make it almost impossible to talk about it sensibly. Quite why this should be, when so many of us are going to suffer from depression or other illnesses, I don't know.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Enlightened voters</unknownNode><unknownNode>I suspect it's because we're frightened of it ourselves. How much better it would be if we could all treat it as we treat physical conditions, like  'flu or cancer or a broken arm.    Mr Bondevik's honesty in putting his cards on the table and telling the people of Norway what was going on in his mind and in his life is admirable. But the reaction of Norwegian voters is just as impressive. </unknownNode><unknownNode>They voted him back into office. If I was being glum, I'd say that it would never happen here because the party leader would find himself the victim of lots of headlines about &ldquo;Voting for a Loony&rdquo;. </unknownNode><unknownNode>But don't tell me there's any reason we should be less enlightened than the Norwegians. </unknownNode><unknownNode>--------------------------------------------------------</unknownNode><unknownNode>There are many organisations that provide help to those that suffer from mental illness. The following is a seleciton of some of them.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Stand to Reason SANE Mental Health Mind</unknownNode><unknownNode>Another day of turmoil on the markets. The US Federal Reserve tried to pre-empt the opening of the US stock exchange with a whopping 0.75% cut in interest rates. Even so, the Dow Jones dropped sharply within minutes.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Tonight, we'll devote much of the programme to analysing what all this means. Paul Mason will look at the impact on the global economy, and Stephanie Flanders will assess what - if anything - the government and the Bank of England can do to prevent a downturn here. We'll be re-convening Newsnight's own Monetary Policy Committee. Do they think the Bank should follow the Fed with a cut in interest rates next week? </unknownNode><unknownNode>Also - some have said it's the most bad-tempered Presidential debate they've seen. Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton may be in the same party, but last night's Democratic debate in South Carolina laid bare the growing ill-feeling between the two candidates. So catty were the exchanges that the third and largely overlooked John Edwards ended up appealing to both candidates to stop squabbling and think about the bigger picture. We'll be speaking to a leading Democrat about whether the tone of the race might damage the party in the long term. </unknownNode><unknownNode>And - the government wants everyone to learn cookery in school. They hope it will mean Britain's kids will eat more healthily. And tomorrow, ministers will unveil their strategy to combat obesity. So we've been back to visit a group of teenagers we first met late last year. They were on a special programme - called MEND - which aims to help them lose weight by bringing the whole family into the process. Lots of them really benefited from the course. Six months on - how are they doing? </unknownNode><unknownNode>The US Federal Reserve has cuts interest rates to 3.5% in a desperate bid to stave off a looming recession.</unknownNode><unknownNode>The rate cut came after global stocks had tumbled on Monday, posting their worst day since the attacks of 11 September 2001.</unknownNode><unknownNode>So, how bad is it going to get? Are we really facing a recession as some of the apocalyptic headline writers would have us believe or is the UK economy strong enough to see out this latest financial storm?</unknownNode><unknownNode>In an effort to find some definitive answers we decided to call an emergency meeting of the fabled Newsnight Monetary Policy Committee (MPC).</unknownNode><unknownNode>So what would you like to ask our expert panel? </unknownNode><unknownNode>I bring grave news:  a legal dispute compels me to disturb the remains of Ethical Man.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>Regular Newsnight viewers and readers of this blog will recall that the corpse of Ethical Man was laid to rest by Britain&rsquo;s King of Compost, John Cossham, in a specially designed compost bin in his suburban garden in York.  We judged composting was the most environmentally friendly way to dispose of a human cadaver.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>I&rsquo;d imagined that that would be the end of the story; the memory of Ethical Man would gradually rot away leaving little more than a rich loam.  Unfortunately it was not to be.  A legal battle rages over our chosen method of disposal... Ethical Man cannot rest in peace.</unknownNode><unknownNode>The claim is that we gave &ldquo;false information on law&rdquo;.  It is a serious claim and is the subject of a formal complaint to the BBC.</unknownNode><unknownNode>So what is at issue?  Well, before Ethical Man lowered himself into his compost grave I said that the only problem was that &ldquo;it isn&rsquo;t actually legal to compost human beings&rdquo;.  We felt that we could side-step this because &ndash; and this may surprise some readers &ndash; I wasn&rsquo;t actually composted.</unknownNode><unknownNode>The complaint is that this is not an accurate representation of the law.  The complainant, who says he is an expert on the law relating to dying and death, says that &ldquo;there is no law that I know of which proscribes the composting of bodies&rdquo;.</unknownNode><unknownNode>He asked me to check the true legal position and issue a correction.  I have to admit that I failed to do this.  I&rsquo;ll be honest here - after the demise of Ethical Man I wanted to move on.  I didn&rsquo;t want to let his shadow affect the rest of my working life.  I moved on to new journalistic pastures (on the One Show) and forgot about the legal complexities of composting corpses.</unknownNode><unknownNode>So is it legal?  Well, I&rsquo;ve spoken to the ultimate authority on this subject, the Ministry of Justice and as so often in law it appears there is no clear answer.  The problem seems to be that no-one has actually tested the law to find out if it is legal.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Under the Births and Deaths legislation all deaths must be registered and when they are, the registrar issues a certificate for the body to be buried or cremated.  The person responsible for the disposal of the body then has to certify to the registrar that the body has been disposed of by burial or cremation.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>So what if someone composted the body instead?  If the registrar did not receive a certificate of burial or cremation then they might refer the disposal to a local environmental health officer who would then have to decide whether composting was a suitable method of disposal.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Test case needed</unknownNode><unknownNode>The law on burials is not clear whether it would be.  The Ministry of Justice says that all the law says is that the body/coffin should be at least three feet below ground level (or no less than two feet in certain circumstances).</unknownNode><unknownNode>There is no requirement for a coffin (which would slow the composting process) but a body would be expected to be covered so as to avoid an offence to public decency.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>The Ministry of Justice adds one final coda. We suggested it might be a good idea to chop the body up into little pieces to ensure a rapid and aerobic compost.  The Ministry warns that any attempt to dismember the body would have to comply with the Human Tissue Act 2004 and that dismemberment might in itself be regarded as an offence to public decency.</unknownNode><unknownNode>In short then, what is needed is a test case to clear up the law on this important subject. So please help. If you are considering composting your corpse or that of a loved one do please contact us so we can follow the process.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Today's programme producer is Liz Gibbons.

That appears to be Alistair Darling's latest plan to solve the problem of the troubled bank. The Tories say the government is gambling with public money. The Lib Dems are accusing the government of being politically frightened of nationalisation. We'll debate what the best thing really is for the tax payer and the bank.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Gaza There are dramatic pictures from Gaza where the power station is not working and the UN claim food supplies are running out because of an Israeli blockade. The Israeli government say recent events have been staged by Hamas and that the people of Gaza are not under any real threat. We're trying to find out the truth.</unknownNode><unknownNode>EU First we were definitely going to get a referendum on an EU constitution. Then it was a debate in parliament about whether we would get a referendum. Now there will not even be a debate. Michael Crick will explain.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Depression We'll also be speaking to the former Norwegian Prime Minister. Why?

Here's his early email to the production team.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Good morning everyone,</unknownNode><unknownNode>There are a few good stories around today. Gordon Brown has used the start of a visit to Beijing to declare that he wants to see a doubling of trade between Britain and China in two years. The Prime Minister said closer co-operation between the two countries could create tens of thousands of jobs for British workers. China currently has a lot of cash to invest abroad.   Meanwhile in the US, President Bush will speak about his economic stimulus package that includes "short-term, temporary measures" to boost an economy buffeted by housing and credit woes. Yesterday Wall Street dropped a massive 300 points over fears of a recession. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Is this a crucial moment in the growing economic power of China? Could we combine both stories? We also have a pre-recorded interview with Senator Chuck Hagel set for this afternoon. Could we add this to the sequence?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Heathrow  Let's pursue new lines on this story. The preliminary report is out tomorrow. Susan Watts is on the case. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Tonight on Newsnight, we begin with the crash landing at Heathrow of British Airways flight 038 from Beijing this lunchtime. There are reports that the pilot lost all avionics - all power failed just prior to landing. The pilots managed to bring it down just short of the runway. Some passengers are being treated at a local hospital but no lives were lost. So what happened to this Boeing 777?  We will bring you as much detail and analysis as we can muster and we are bidding for the Chief Executive of BA Willie Walsh.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Also tonight - is the government inadvertently funding the visits to Britain of controversial radical Muslim clerics?  On the day that the Home Secretary Jacqui Smith gave a speech on measures the government is taking to prevent radicalisation, is the government engaging with the right organisations? Richard Watson has uncovered evidence that a government funded organisation is using speakers to address young British Muslims who fundamentally disagree with democracy.</unknownNode><unknownNode>And Tim Burton turns Stephen Sondheim's musical Sweeney Todd into a celluloid gothic horror show, with Johnny Depp as the demon barber. Tonight Newsnight has the first British interview with the star.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Carol Rubra is today's programme producer. Here is her early email to the team. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Good morning,</unknownNode><unknownNode>We have lots of space on the programme today so it's a good opportunity for us to go our own way and make some news. </unknownNode><unknownNode>This is what is planned...</unknownNode><unknownNode>Jacqui Smith is giving a speech about terrorism and how to prevent vulnerable people becoming radicalised by extremist websites.

Or do we need road pricing?</unknownNode><unknownNode>See you at 10.30</unknownNode><unknownNode>Tonight on Newsnight we've another disturbing film about how terrorists operate here in Britain. Last night we heard how  a website with a known record of support for Al Qaeda had announced the formation of a branch of the organisation in Britain. Tonight we have the story of "Terrorist 007". It is the compelling tale of how a young man ran a cyber terror network from his home in West London.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Mark Urban has been looking into Russian-British relations. Last night Stephen Kinnock - son of Lord Kinnock and the director of the British Council office in St Petersburg - was arrested. The British Council offices in the two cities are now closed.

Michael Crick is trying to ask different ones about the donations to his failed deputy leadership campaign. Do find out whether Michael succeeds in getting any answers.</unknownNode><unknownNode>And we plan to debate the Diana Inquest - and the media circus that is surrounding the event, lawyers permitting.</unknownNode><unknownNode>All will be revealed at 10.30pm</unknownNode><unknownNode>Simon Enright </unknownNode><unknownNode>Some of you may recall reports of much excitement in the Newsnight offices a couple of years back following the return of the Newsnight mouse.

Ninety per cent of doctors voted to take up this new option, which meant that NHS Primary Care Trusts now had the task of filling doctors' surgeries at nights and weekends. Who is doing that work? More and more of the shifts are being filled with doctors from throughout the European Union, especially Poland. Some are even commuting from the continent to work in Britain at weekends - they can earn in one shift what they would take home in a month in Poland. But could all the travelling make these doctors too tired to treat patients? And who is responsible for them?

Northern Rock said shareholders had defeated all but one of the resolutions proposed at its extraordinary meeting. The bank's chairman said the resolution passed would not be a "material restriction" to a rescue deal. The resolutions were put forward by two major shareholders, hedge funds SRM Global and RAB Capital. "Whilst we are pleased that all but one of the resolutions proposed by SRM and RAB Capital were not carried, we recognise that a material number of shareholders did vote in favour of these resolutions," said Bryan Sanderson, Northern Rock's chairman.

In October Simon Ostrovsky's report revealed how many of the UK's top High Street stores were selling clothes made with Uzbek cotton. His investigation of cotton production in Uzbekistan found that the use of children to harvest the crop was widespread and systematic. Tesco said the Newsnight report had "exposed the continued use of state-sponsored child labour in Uzbek cotton fields" and has now announced a complete ban on the use of Uzbek cotton. The retail giant is telling suppliers that "the use of organised and forced child labour is completely unacceptable and leads us to conclude that whilst these practices persist in Uzbekistan we cannot support the use of cotton from Uzbekistan in our textiles".  Watch Simon's report on tonight's programme.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Read the reactions of the High Street stores..</unknownNode><unknownNode>For those of you glued to your PCs over the issue of David Cameron's non-declared flights, as reported below and on Newsnight last night, the Conservatives have now responded, registering the Dewsbury flight and correcting the name of the donor on another flight.

Full traceability of where raw cotton (used in yarn, cotton fabrics or garments) originates from is very difficult to achieve. </unknownNode><unknownNode>So at this time we do not believe a boycott of cotton from Uzbekistan is achievable, but more importantly we are not convinced it will improve the lives of those who work in the industry. </unknownNode><unknownNode>We will continue to work with the Government and our suppliers to discuss what further pressure we can apply to bring about an improvement in the conditions of people working in the cotton industry in Uzbekistan."</unknownNode><unknownNode>Arcadia Group (Burtons and Top Man)  "Further to the BBC Newsnight programme, we have contacted all of our suppliers and  informed them of your findings. </unknownNode><unknownNode>We have re-iterated to them our code of conduct which can be found on our group web-site www.arcadiagroup.co.uk.</unknownNode><unknownNode>We have requested that our suppliers check on their raw cotton sources, and nothing  untoward has been reported to us by them, nor have we found anything untoward  ourselves at this time." </unknownNode><unknownNode>Matalan &ldquo;Matalan is taking the issue seriously and is in consultation with its suppliers to understand the extent of the issue.

The story predicted almost universally was a convincing win for Barack Obama over Hillary Clinton in the state of New Hampshire. Some commentators even went so far as to discuss Hillary's need for 'damage limitation' if she ever wanted to work in politics again. In the end - and surely this is what News is all about - she won New Hampshire, leaving the Obama team, the pollsters and some  media scrabbling for a duvet day. Tonight, we'll discuss how the pollsters and the truth were so wide apart and just what swayed it for Hillary when it had all seemed like a done deal. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Official Secrets: </unknownNode><unknownNode>A Foreign Office civil servant - accused of leaking confidential documents - has been cleared of breaching the Official Secrets Act. Prosecutors at the Old Bailey have decided to drop charges against Derek Pasquill - who was accused of disclosing papers to the media. We'll talk live to Derek Pasquill  - a man who's had his life on hold for the past two years - on the programme. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Economy:  </unknownNode><unknownNode>Marks and Spencers sales figures are as much a bellwether of the UK economy as interest rates or house prices. As their chief executive revealed today how disappointing the Christmas period had been, we ask if the High Street boom is finally over. Have consumers stopped consuming? And will there be interest rates cuts tomorrow? We ask our Newsnight Shadow MPC. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Galloway v Frum:</unknownNode><unknownNode>George Galloway is not a big fan of American policy in the Middle East. David Frum is not a big fan of Iranian policy towards the West - he coined the Axis of Evil phrase for George Bush. As the President begins his last big tour of the Middle East - and threatens US sanctions on Iran - we put the two together to tell us what's what. This is just a guess, but it may not be all sweetness and light. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Belly dancer</unknownNode><unknownNode>It was already one of the most eccentric stories to come out of the Foreign Office in a long while. Britain&rsquo;s Ambassador to Uzbekistan gets fired after criticising the country&rsquo;s human rights record and carrying on with a 22-year-old local belly dancer. Now the story of Craig Murray has taken another equally eye-brow raising twist. He and his girlfriend are back in Britain &ndash; and they&rsquo;ve written a play about how they met. The piece, performed solely by his partner Nadira Berkhanov-Murray, is more harrowing than you might expect. Madeleine Holt has the report.</unknownNode><unknownNode> </unknownNode><unknownNode>One of my favourite Christmas presents this year was an excellent, highly readable, biography of Arthur Balfour by the American academic RJQ Adams (Read The Times review here). Not only was Balfour Conservative Prime Minister from 1902-05, he was still in Cabinet more than 24 years after leaving Downing Street, and &ndash; little known fact this &ndash; Vice-President of Manchester United.  He was also responsible for the phrase &lsquo;Bob&rsquo;s your uncle!&rsquo;, a reference to his promotions from the Tory leader Lord Salisbury, whom Balfour succeeded as PM, and just happened to be Balfour's uncle.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Hilary Clinton&rsquo;s surprise success in New Hampshire, and Jeremy&rsquo;s interesting exchanges with the 19-year old Bhutto heir yesterday (watch it here), got me thinking again how about importance families still are in modern politics, even in the democratic age.  If Hilary Clinton reaches the White House, and goes on to complete a second term, then America will have been run by either Bushes or Clintons for the whole 28 year period from 1989 to 2017 (with Bush Senior also Vice-President from 1981 to 1989).  </unknownNode><unknownNode>In Britain, Gordon Brown&rsquo;s Cabinet has Hilary Benn, of course, the son, grandson and great-grandson of MPs, (and the father of one, too, in all probability, given that his daughter recently became a Labour candidate at the age of just 18).  Then we have Ed Balls and his wife Yvette Cooper; the Miliband brothers; and Douglas Alexander, the brother of Wendy, Labour&rsquo;s new leader in Scotland.  Indeed, a Cambridge academic David Runciman has recently argued in the London Review of Books that the Brown administration is a real &ldquo;family affair&rdquo; and reminds him of the era of the Pitts (Elder, Younger and various relations) in the late eighteenth century.  (Runciman should know something about political genes.  He himself comes from one of Britain&rsquo;s most distinguished families, and is heir to the Runciman viscountcy - the first viscount sat in the cabinets of Asquith, Lloyd George and Stanley Baldwin).</unknownNode><unknownNode>In some ways it&rsquo;s obvious why family relationships should be so important in political careers &ndash; it&rsquo;s in the blood, one meets important people at a very early age, one has the benefit of family advice, experience and wisdom, and there may be the odd bit of string-pulling too.</unknownNode><unknownNode>But there&rsquo;s another factor, as well, I think, particularly in conservative societies like America and South Asia. Human beings seem to like dynastic government.  Hence the prevalence of monarchies throughout history. Maybe there&rsquo;s something psychologically comforting about being ruled by people who are related to each other. Perhaps we value genetic continuity.</unknownNode><unknownNode>It&rsquo;s worth exploring. I&rsquo;d love to do a TV or radio programme on it one day, but so far my bids have all been rejected.      </unknownNode><unknownNode>Robert Morgan is today's programme producer - here is his early email to the team. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Hello everyone,</unknownNode><unknownNode>There's quite a bit around today. </unknownNode><unknownNode>There's been a shock result in New Hampshire with egg on the faces of the pollsters and some of the media. Hillary Clinton and John McCain are the comeback kids. David and Ben are there. How should we do this story today?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Shares in Marks and Spencer have fallen sharply this morning, after the company announced disappointing Christmas sales figures. They were down more than two percent in the final three months of 2007, and the company has warned that it expects to have a tough time this year as well. Is the high street boom finally over?

Judge for yourself on tonight's programme.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Our main story tonight though, is the news that the cabinet have approved a new generation of nuclear power plants. Gordon Brown has told us that the full energy statement will be out on Thursday. But tonight we'll debate whether Nuclear is the answer to our energy needs - and also a solution to the problems of climate change. Our Science Editor Susan Watts has her assessment of the real facts behind the nuclear option.</unknownNode><unknownNode>In a few hours we'll know whether Barack Obama has done it again - and won the Democratic Primary this time in New Hampshire. It would be tough for Hillary to comeback from another defeat.  But tonight David Grossman also reports on the race for the Republican nomination. It is much less clear who will win - with Mike Huckerbee the winner in Iowa not expected to do so well in New Hampshire and Vietnam Vet John McCain tipped to win. We'll be talking to Republican pollster Frank Luntz and independent pollster Scot Rasmussen about their take on the candidates.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Finally, the story from Kenya where today saw more clashes after the current president announced his new cabinet. Paul Mason has spoken to some of those involved in the violence to ask them why they are fighting.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>Newsnight is now on iPlayer - the BBC's new service that allows you to catch up with television programmes you've missed.</unknownNode><unknownNode>You can now watch The Week on Newsnight for seven days after it's broadcast on News 24.</unknownNode><unknownNode>This week Paul Mason reports on the unrest in Kenya following the disputed elections there.

Gordon Brown this morning announced plans for a national screening programme for heart disease, strokes, kidney disease and other conditions. It's all part, he says, of a plan to make the NHS focus more on "preventative" rather than simply "curative" treatments. Already though his plans have met with a mixed reaction - the BMA have complained that there is no point screening for conditions that they don't have the money to treat, and even the UK National Screening Committee have questioned whether it is the best use of NHS resources. We'll debate Brown's vision for the health service.</unknownNode><unknownNode>How Kibera Was "Cleared" Paul Mason has a powerful film on how the huge shanty town of Kibera in Nairobi was torn apart by ethnic violence following the contested Kenyan election. Over the course of a single night a multi-ethnic neighbourhood was brutally cleared of members of the Kikuyu community. He has filmed extensively in the area and meets with one Kikuyu in fear of her life who is in hiding in the shanty town.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Clinton vs Obama Plus, Hilary Clinton's desperate attempts to halt Barack Obama in New Hampshire. What must she do now, and could it already be too late?</unknownNode><unknownNode>So which British political party would select a leader who was 71? OK, John McCain hasn't won the Republican nomination yet, but for him even to be leading contender for the US presidency is in stark contrast to Britain, where our party leaders seem to get younger and younger.

Or rather, a call to ears and eyeballs - yours. 	 It demands your attention, and - together with an arresting headline - provides some dramatic punctuation that makes it clear this isn&rsquo;t a continuation of the Graham Norton Show. 	 The music was written by George Fenton, a man whose distinguished musical range spans movies like Gandhi, The Madness of King George and Groundhog Day. 	 He also had a bit part years ago in Emmerdale Farm.  (Where did it all go wrong?!) 	 Lime groove 	 The original version of the Newsnight theme was recorded at Lime Grove&rsquo;s television music studio, a few roads away from us in London&rsquo;s verdant Shepherd&rsquo;s Bush.  It was remixed in the mid-90s to, erm, sex it up a bit: turning the electric guitar up to 11, giving it more stereo oomph for the coming digital age.   	 (Rock&rsquo;n&rsquo;roll mythology has it that our esteemed Editor, Peter, played guitar on a further remix last year.) 	 The French horns carry the tune in an innovative musical line-up that few composers outside of the Beach Boys&rsquo; in-house genius Brian Wilson would get away with.  (Wilson combines a French horn with a harmonica in the intro to God Only Knows.) 	 In a quirky twist of television fate, the music studio where the Newsnight theme was remixed is now home to CBeebies and CBBC, the BBC&rsquo;s offerings for younger viewers.  But Newsnight&rsquo;s youthful connections don&rsquo;t stop there. 	 Studio swap 	 The studio that Newsnight comes from nightly was once home to kids&rsquo; weekend jollities such as Multi-Coloured Swap Shop, Saturday Superstore and Going Live.  Imagine it: our Emily purveying serious journalism only inches away from where Keith Chegwin used to giggle his guts off! 	 Sometimes when I traipse the long corridor back from the studio to the office after Newsnight has finished, I fancy I can hear the ghostly pleas of Noel Edmonds demanding a chance to break free of Swap Shop and present a grown-ups&rsquo; quiz show featuring an inaudible banker. 	 Or maybe it&rsquo;s Fenton&rsquo;s masterpiece still ringing in my ears.   	 The tension of the timpani roll at the beginning and the brooding Newsnight theme that follows imply a world in turmoil.  But the musical resolution with the horns riding high at the end says, it might be a dark world out there but Emily&rsquo;s done her level best to help you make sense of it.

Where the opposition parties and the media sense that a government is in trouble, then small crises become big ones, and ministers spent the autumn dogged by the woes of Northern Rock, the missing Revenue &amp; Customs discs, and a new party funding scandal.</unknownNode><unknownNode>If George Osborne is a strong contender for politician of the year, he&rsquo;s not without opposition.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>On the government side, my nominee would be Jack Straw, the great survivor, who has sat continuously on the Labour front bench since 1981.  Well before Tony Blair finally stood down, Straw took command of Gordon Brown&rsquo;s leadership campaign, and handled it brilliantly, to the extent that all possible opposition was deterred or barred from standing - including David Miliband and John Reid.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Politician of the year</unknownNode><unknownNode>So ruthless and determined was the Brown camp in collecting nominations that the only other declared contender, John McDonnell, failed to get enough MPs to back him.  Indeed, a little known fact was that with nominations from 313 Labour MPs by the end, Gordon Brown could boast that, excluding Irish members and the Speaker and his deputies, he had been backed by a majority of British MPs.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>Other contenders for politician of the year must surely include Alex Salmond, for his success in becoming first minister of Scotland; those other great survivors Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness, for finally agreeing power-sharing (and working together like life-long chums); and of course, the Lib Dem acting leader (after Ming Campbell&rsquo;s resignation) Vince Cable, whose line about Gordon Brown turning from Stalin to Mr Bean was the most memorable Commons quote of the year.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>Cable impresses voters with his air of common sense of reasonableness, and in a TV studio has the disarming and attractive tactic of agreeing with about half of what his opponent says, before then gently explaining why the other half is rubbish. </unknownNode><unknownNode>There&rsquo;s clearly a bit of needle in his exchanges with Gordon Brown - perhaps because Cable is a decent economist (who has excelled on Northern Rock).  Maybe because the two men used to work together when they were both members of the Labour Party in Scotland in the 1970s, and they both contributed to the Socialist Red Paper on Scotland.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>Nick Clegg will have great difficulty matching Cable&rsquo;s performances in the Commons.  The new Liberal Democrat leader launched his leadership campaign in Sheffield by saying his party&rsquo;s new leader would need to take risks, but then, as front-runner, ran a campaign which did anything but take risks - nor, does his new front bench team announced just before Christmas suggest the kind of risk-taking he spoke of.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>Risk-takers</unknownNode><unknownNode>Unless Clegg does shake up his party in quite a radical way, at the cost of annoying a few Lib Dems, then he&rsquo;ll find it hard to win back voters at a time when the centre ground of British politics has become exceedingly crowded.  One such risk (though hardly a great vote-winner) could be to drop &lsquo;Liberal Democrat&rsquo; in favour of plain Liberal - the term he frequently he used during his leadership challenge, not, it seems, by accident.          George Osborne and David Cameron could tell Nick Clegg a thing or two about taking risks.  I&rsquo;m told there was quite a debate within the Tory high command over whether Osborne should actually announce his tax measures in Blackpool.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>The risk-takers argued that the Tories had to do something to win back ground ahead of a likely election.  More cautious heads argued that cutting inheritance tax might backfire, and that tax cuts were no longer a great vote-winner.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>Ultimately the risk-takers prevailed, Osborne made his speech, and the story of 2007 took us in a very new direction. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Afghanistan</unknownNode><unknownNode>We have the first television pictures  from  the battle for Musa Qala. I've been talking to the British ambassador in Kabul and we 'll also  be asking International Development Secretary Douglas Alexander about the other battle in Afghanistan - the one for hearts and minds.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Omagh</unknownNode><unknownNode>In October Susan Watts reported on the growing doubts about one type of forensic evidence - it was called Low Copy Number DNA. Today the man accused of the Omagh bombing was found not guilty and in part that was because the judge did not find this evidence convincing. Should this type of evidence ever be used? We'll debate.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Sex</unknownNode><unknownNode>Should men who pay for sex be targeted for prosecution? Everyone agrees the idea of women being forced into prostitution is despicable, the sex trade from abroad into Britain is a key target for the police and for the government. But today Harriet Harman talked of targeting the men who pay for sex - would doing that be a good idea? And if it is a good idea, would it really have much of an impact on the trade in women forced into prostitution?   Plastic Bags</unknownNode><unknownNode>For me one of the most inspiring stories of the year is that of the BBC photographer who made a documentary about plastic pollution in Hawaii. If you saw Rebecca Hosking's documentary Hawaii: Message in the Waves you will have been appalled by the impact plastic has had on the lives of albatrosses, dolphins and other sea creatures. But when Rebecca returned home she talked to neighbours and friends in her small village in Devon ... and the result was a grassroots movement to do away with plastic bags as much as possible. Rebecca is one of  our Newsnight End of the Year interviews.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Gavin</unknownNode><unknownNode>Have British attitudes towards paying for sex changed? </unknownNode><unknownNode>This morning the leader of the commons Harriet Harman called for sex payments to be made illegal. </unknownNode><unknownNode>She's worried about the increase in the international trafficking of women. </unknownNode><unknownNode>But is outlawing paying for sex the best way of tackling this problem and is there a wider attitude towards sex and money that need to change? We want to hear your views. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Simon Enright is today's programme producer - here is his early email to the team. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Morning All,</unknownNode><unknownNode>Shake off those post-party foggy heads we've got work to do.</unknownNode><unknownNode>We hope to run a film of the battle for Musa Qala. Stephen Grey is flying back from Kandahar and we have the footage. Who should we talk to off the back?</unknownNode><unknownNode>We know today we'll get the verdict on the Omagh case. Remember Susan Watts film which looked at the evidence based on Low Copy Number DNA and asked whether this kind of evidence was good enough? Can we have a Justice minister on to defend it OR someone from the legal profession - against the Omagh defence lawyer.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Today's end of year interview is with Rebecca Hoskings who changed our perspective on plastic bags. </unknownNode><unknownNode>And then what else should we do? </unknownNode><unknownNode>Should we outlaw paying for sex - Harriet Harman calls for change in the law.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Should we not follow up on Zuma and the possible corruption charges he might face?

Have they now managed to spend all our money?</unknownNode><unknownNode> Simon</unknownNode><unknownNode>Guantanamo</unknownNode><unknownNode>Three British residents who were being held by the US at Guantanamo Bay have been released and are due to land in the UK at any moment.  British police are accompanying them on the flight.  What's not clear is what will happen to them when they get here  - the Pentagon insists they still pose a danger to the public, and the Tories say they are yet to receive reassurances from the government about how they intend to protect the public from these "dangers". Newsnight reported key revelations about one of the released men some years ago. Tonight - we assess how much of a danger these men are, and debate how they should be treated on their return. </unknownNode><unknownNode> Russian Art</unknownNode><unknownNode>It seems that a high profile exhibition of art due to open at the Royal Academy in London in January is to be cancelled. The Russian government is on the verge of making the move, claming that the art - which belongs to Russian galleries such as Hermitage in St Petersburg - could be seized to settle private legal claims. But it comes just days after Russia demanded that the British Council close its branch offices in the New Year, in the wake of the row over the murder of former Russian agent Alexander Litvinenko. So the cooling of relations now seems to be impacting on Britain and Russia's cultural ties. We'll have the latest.</unknownNode><unknownNode> Mark Ronson </unknownNode><unknownNode>Only a year ago - you'd might never heard of him. The chances are that you have now. And even if you haven't, you've probably been humming his tunes without even knowing it. Mark Ronson has burst on to the music scene this year. His collaboration with Amy Winehouse and his album of covers - "Version" - have earned him a coveted Grammy nomination and a legion of fans. Our Culture Correspondent Steve Smith caught up with him for one of our End of Year Interviews. And if you want to know how Amy Winehouse's single "Rehab" came to be written - then it's a must watch. </unknownNode><unknownNode> What Happened Next?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Remember the hundreds of haemophiliacs whom Newsnight revealed had been infected with HIV in the 1980s? Remember the Iraqi translators who worked for British troops but were refused asylum here? Remember the head of a so-called "vulture fund" known as "Goldfinger"? Tonight, we'll be updating you on some of the key investigations Newsnight has worked on this year. And one or two of the lighter items too.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Liz Gibbons is today's programme producer - here is her early email to the team. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Brown's last press conference of the year at 11am - he's bringing Alistair Darling along. So I think he's anticipated the likely line of questioning. Should we assess the state of Brown's premiership? Who do you want to hear from?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Stephanie is trawling through the minutes of the MPC interest rates decision - published this morning.</unknownNode><unknownNode>We've got an update on some of the investigations we ran this year in the form of a 14-ish minute piece.</unknownNode><unknownNode>And - oh my god I can't believe it - an end of year interview with Mark Ronson.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Anything else we should be pursuing? </unknownNode><unknownNode>It&rsquo;s been a fairly prized day for Nick Clegg, and not just for winning the Lib Dem leadership contest. He has won himself another title as some of the Newsnight female staff have commented on his striking resemblance to Mr Darcy, aka Colin Firth.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Frequent images of Clegg on the news throughout the day prompted one of the ladies to spark off this debate. Maybe it&rsquo;s the skin colour, the slightly foppy brown hair or the suit and tie that recalls that Bridget Jones moment. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Do join in the debate and let us know what you think &ndash; would you swoon if you saw Nick Clegg walking towards you in a sodden shirt? </unknownNode><unknownNode>Let&rsquo;s not beat around the bush: Christmas is a carbon catastrophe and the reason is our ludicrous culture of present giving.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>I know I&rsquo;ll be called a mean old Scrooge but here&rsquo;s the Christmas manifesto of this (former) Ethical Man: if you must give, give money.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Why?  Because you don&rsquo;t have to want Tiny Tim to starve in the workhouse to recognise what bloated consumer nightmare the festive season has become.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Take my family, for example.  We try to meet up over the Christmas period but I am beginning to wish we didn&rsquo;t.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Not because I don&rsquo;t enjoy seeing everyone and eating and drinking far too much before falling asleep in front of the telly.  Last Christmas I couldn&rsquo;t wait to tuck into Ned, the Newsnight turkey.  No, the reason is that I hate giving presents.</unknownNode><unknownNode>There you go you see &ndash; you are thinking I&rsquo;m an old Scrooge aren&rsquo;t you?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Well I say bah humbug to that.  I hate receiving presents too and here&rsquo;s why.</unknownNode><unknownNode> I&rsquo;ve got three children and they have ten cousins.  If each of my children buys everyone a present that&rsquo;s thirty-six presents.  If all the cousins do the same we&rsquo;re talking 13x12 presents &ndash; a staggering 156 in all.</unknownNode><unknownNode>And that is just the start.  We&rsquo;ve got to get presents for my folks, my three sisters and their husbands, my mother-in-law and her partner as well as my father-in-law, my wife&rsquo;s grandmother and her brother.  Then, of course, they&rsquo;ve all got to do the same for us.  So that&rsquo;s another 9x8 presents &ndash; 72 more gifts - even if we assume that couples get just one present.</unknownNode><unknownNode>So my direct family alone could buy each other as many as 228 presents every single year and that&rsquo;s before I&rsquo;ve popped over to my cousin Xand&rsquo;s for a mulled wine or two (another present plus one for my Aunt Anthea) or even begun to think about presents for friends (not that I do, you understand).</unknownNode><unknownNode>So why are these 228 presents a carbon catastrophe?  That&rsquo;s simple: because every single one has a carbon cost.  It wouldn&rsquo;t be a problem if this glut of gifts were actually useful.  But be honest, when was the last time you actually got something you wanted or more importantly, needed?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Tsunami of tat </unknownNode><unknownNode>My children are too young to read this blog so I can be completely honest here.  They now get so many presents that we collect up the ones we don&rsquo;t like and give them to the local charity shop.  I know it sounds cruel but we live in a small house and we would be engulfed in a veritable tsunami of tat if we didn&rsquo;t.</unknownNode><unknownNode>The real problem is that giving presents is an inherently inefficient activity.  It means guessing what someone else may want or need.  Every now and then you&rsquo;ll buy the perfect shirt but more often than not the ornament or tie or garden thermometer will end up in the attic or more likely in a landfill site and all the carbon that went into making it is completely wasted.</unknownNode><unknownNode>A few decades ago you probably needed the socks that your mum gave you or the saucepan she was given by her Aunt.  These days it is different.  Consumer goods are so cheap and plentiful that even people on very low incomes have no shortage of stuff. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Indeed, if you need proof of how corrupt our present giving culture has become look no further than the &ldquo;gift&rdquo; shops that have colonised every high street.  You know the ones; they sell things no-one wants like scented candles, little vases and foot massage kits.  Nevertheless they seem to do reasonable business.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Cash is best</unknownNode><unknownNode>Some of you may be thinking that I&rsquo;m missing the point.  You&rsquo;re thinking that present giving isn&rsquo;t about the inherent value or utility of the gift but is about the act of giving itself.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>I&rsquo;ll concede there&rsquo;s something in that but gifts don&rsquo;t have to be useless. I&rsquo;ve got a rule of only buying consumables as presents: food and drink (and sometimes fireworks).  At least you know someone is going to enjoy them.</unknownNode><unknownNode>But surely it would be more ethical if we all bought each other stuff that you knew we really needed.  Stuff like washing up liquid, toilet paper and breakfast cereal.  Or better still, cash.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>I&rsquo;ve never understood why giving money is considered bad form.  Wasn&rsquo;t that five pound note folded into Granny&rsquo;s card the very best present of all?  You could use it to buy something you actually wanted.  Not only that, cash is completely carbon free (until you buy something, of course).</unknownNode><unknownNode>Hence my Christmas manifesto.</unknownNode><unknownNode>But by way of a post-script I&rsquo;ve got a bit of an ethical confession to make.  I&rsquo;m still sufficiently in thrall to Christmas to feel obliged to give some gifts so direct family are getting goats (and a couple of toilets for really special people).  And my daughters are getting appalling plastic dolls which shed &ldquo;real tears&rdquo; and giggle. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Which, I suppose, goes to prove one of the central problems of tackling global warming:  it is one thing to get people worried about the issue, quite another to get them to do anything about it.</unknownNode><unknownNode>And on that note, Merry Christmas.</unknownNode><unknownNode> </unknownNode><unknownNode>Lib Dems pick a new leader (again)</unknownNode><unknownNode>Nick Clegg has scraped through to win the Liberal Democrat leadership election. His majority of 511 votes over his rival Chris Huhne was anything but resounding, in fact it was the closest ever leadership election in the history of the Liberal Democrats. The former leader Charles Kennedy on his demise, said of his party that they had "passed on the knife to a new generation&rdquo;. So will Nick Clegg be able to unite his party and make this the last leadership election for a while? Jeremy will be speaking to Nick Clegg and we will be assessing his prospects with our political panel. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Economy</unknownNode><unknownNode>Governor of the Bank of England Mervyn King was in front of the Treasury Select Committee this morning answering their questions on the strength of the British economy and on who was the source for the Sunday Times report on how low morale in the Treasury was hampering its response to the Northern Rock crisis. Stephanie Flanders will be explaining what it all means.</unknownNode><unknownNode>South Africa</unknownNode><unknownNode>In an acrimonious contest South Africa's ruling party the African National Congress have now finished casting their votes for a new leader. The front runner is Jacob Zuma who will then be the likely President of South Africa in 2009 when Thabo Mbeki's term ends. We should have the result of the election before we go on air. Peter Marshall has been looking at Jacob Zuma's controversial past and what his election will mean for the ANC and for South Africa. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Ben Parkinson</unknownNode><unknownNode>Lance Bombardier Ben Parkinson was serving with the 7th Parachute Regiment Royal Horse Artillery when he lost both legs in an explosion in Afghanistan a year ago. The 23-year-old sustained 37 injuries in total, including ones to the brain, spine, skull, spleen and chest, yet he was awarded less than half of the compensation available because of the way the Ministry of Defence scheme is calculated.  In our series of End of Year interviews Kirsty has been talking to Ben's mother Diane Dernie about her son's ordeal and her campaign to improve the treatment and compensation given to injured soldiers. </unknownNode><unknownNode>"Newsnight viewers, being a sophisticated lot, have no need of translation," said Jeremy - and it appears he was right.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Because how else can we explain the fact that no one contacted us to claim a prize for "the most imaginative translation" of Fabio Capello's speech? Watch it here</unknownNode><unknownNode>Or perhaps you thought a Newsnight prize sounded pretty unappealing..</unknownNode><unknownNode>But just in case there is anyone at the back of the class who didn't understand what the new England manager said  - here is the Newsnight translation:</unknownNode><unknownNode>"Being manager of a national team is very different to being a manager who can work with a team day in day out.  So we have to all adjust our behaviour - manager and players.  Because all of us in that moment come to represent a nation - we have an important jersey we have to wear."</unknownNode><unknownNode>Carol Rubra is today's programme producer - here is her early email to the team. What do you think we should cover?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Good morning,</unknownNode><unknownNode>There are several interesting stories around today.

Vince Cable has proved an impressive interim leader so what are the challenges for the new leader?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Mervyn King - he's giving evidence to the Treasury Select Committee. We might get more details about who was warned about flaws in the regulatory framework and when. The Bank of England has also increased the amount of support they are giving to Northern Rock today by underwriting loans provided by other banks. What does this mean for the tax payer? </unknownNode><unknownNode>Immigration - under the legacy exercise 37% of asylum seekers have been given leave to remain. Is this the best way of dealing with the problem?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Honours - Tony Wright's committee has 44 recommendations about what should be done.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Turkey has made the biggest incursion into Northern Iraq since 2003. And Condie is in Kirkuk. How will this affect the stability of the region?</unknownNode><unknownNode>ANC - members have begun voting. Peter Marshall has a profile of Jacob Zuma.</unknownNode><unknownNode>And we have an End of Year interview with Diane Parkinson who has been campaigning for the overhaul of the compensation scheme for injured soldiers after her son Ben became the most seriously injured soldier ever to survive. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Please lots of ideas to the meeting for guests and treatments.</unknownNode><unknownNode> </unknownNode><unknownNode>DATA DEBACLE 2.0 News tonight of the loss of yet more of our personal data by the government: this time it is 3m who've taken the driving theory test. That on the day that Alistair Darling informed the Commons about an interim report into the last big loss - the details of 25m people from families who claim child benefit.

They say we&rsquo;ve missed the main point, that extremist books were recovered in any case. </unknownNode><unknownNode>A quick reminder: In what Policy Exchange billed as the most comprehensive academic study of its kind, four teams of two researchers, not on Policy Exchange&rsquo;s staff but working on their behalf, had visited 100 mosques and found that in a quarter of the locations they were able to buy or acquire extremist literature.

Seven months after his first visit, Mark Urban returns to Doura with the 30 men of 2nd Platoon, 12th Infantry of the US Army. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Where once there was chaos and frequent killings, now a degree of normality has been restored. Mark goes on patrol, sees the sectarian peace walls, speaks to Sunnis and Shias, and considers whether the security gains brought by the "surge" can be sustained. We also hear from the troops on the ground as they end their 15 month tour of duty. Was the loss of their comrades in arms worth the relative peace now secured in Doura?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Climate Change</unknownNode><unknownNode>As the climate talks in Bali stutter forwards, the EU is stressing that any future deal on climate change will fail unless it is seen to be fair. The new polluters India and China object to the current system of measuring emissions on a countrywide basis because they say it disguises the fact that their emissions per person are comparatively low.  In the case of India, one twentieth the level of the average American. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Many delegates say that per capita emissions should become part of any final deal, so what are the facts? We have a series of films from around the world, and an interview with the environment secretary Hilary Benn, live from Bali.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Algerian Attack</unknownNode><unknownNode>We'll also look at who was behind today's terror attack in Algeria - just how big a threat is Al Queda in North Africa?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Today&rsquo;s output editor is Dan Kelly &ndash; here&rsquo;s his morning e-mail to the production team.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Good morning.  Seven months after his first visit, Mark Urban returns to al-Doura with US 2nd Platoon. After "the surge" of troops in Baghdad the change in al-Doura has been dramatic. Mark goes on patrol, sees the sectarian peace walls, speaks to Sunnis and Shias, and considers whether the security gains brought by the surge policy can be sustained. </unknownNode><unknownNode>We have a film from Roger Harrabin about the per capita emissions of developed and developing world countries. We have a live interview with the Environment Secretary Hilary Benn, and we hope to have a wider discussion about the chances of success at the conference.</unknownNode><unknownNode>We need to keep an eye on Afghanistan, too...</unknownNode><unknownNode>We continue our series of daily debates on alcohol, ahead of Thursday&rsquo;s special programme, Boozenight.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Today we want to focus on whether the government has got it right with drinking legislation.  Consider three areas:</unknownNode><unknownNode>24 hour licensing, which is now just over two years old.  Has this brought us any closer to the drinking culture of our continental cousins, or merely aggravated the already high incidents of binge drinking and anti-social behaviour?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Consider also whether the minimum drinking age is still appropriate?  In an effort to tackle teenage drinking, should the age be raised from 18 to 21, perhaps?  Or should it be lowered?</unknownNode><unknownNode>And what of advertising?

Two British soldiers have been killed in the fighting and hundreds of civilians have fled the area. The Prime Minister, who was in Kabul today, promised to follow up victory with economic assistance for an area that currently provides half the world's heroin. We'll have the latest from Mark Urban on how Musa Qala was taken and whether it can be held.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Basra</unknownNode><unknownNode>Meanwhile on a visit to Basra yesterday Gordon Brown confirmed that the province will be handed over to the Iraqis within a fortnight.  But what deals had to be struck with local Shiite militias to enable the pullout to take place?  Mark has been speaking to General Bill Rollo, the highest ranking British soldier in the Iraq theatre.  So is he saying it'll all be over by Christmas? Well, not quite.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Conrad Black</unknownNode><unknownNode>The erstwhile press baron will likely be sentenced to between six and a half and eight years in jail, he was told by a US judge today. But in an interview for Newsnight, recorded last week from his Palm Beach mansion Conrad Black was still protesting his innocence. He also told us that if he was sent to jail that wouldn't be the end of his battle to clear his name. We'll bring you that interview tonight.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Kosovo</unknownNode><unknownNode>Kosovan Albanians and Kosovan Serbs are not quite at daggers drawn yet but relations are at their worst ebb since NATO bombed Slobodan Milo&scaron;ević out of power back in 1999. Today was supposed to be the deadline by which a deal on the final status of Kosovo was agreed with the UN. No deal has been reached so what will happen now? Allan Little has been to Kosovo to find out if the troubled province can ever peacefully become a nation. And we'll interview David Miliband who has been in Brussels trying to hammer out the European Union stance on the way forward.   And in what many here think is the music event of the year for middle-aged headbangers, Led Zeppelin will be playing their first proper concert for 19 years. We're hoping to playout from there. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Britain&rsquo;s love/hate relationship with alcohol has led to many headlines over the past 12 months.  24-hour licensing has been a reality in England and Wales for two years now, binge drinking stories are often in the news, and doctors have been alarmed by the rise in the number of cases of alcohol-related illnesses.</unknownNode><unknownNode>With 15 drinking days to go until Christmas, Newsnight is making ready for Boozenight.  In Thursday&rsquo;s programme, we&rsquo;ll debate many of the issues that have been shaping our perception of the nation&rsquo;s relationship with alcohol.</unknownNode><unknownNode>But we start the discussion today.

Peter Marshall reveals the tensions and rows that have marked the administration's policy towards Tehran.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Media mogul</unknownNode><unknownNode>James Murdoch is now officially a 21st Century media mogul. Rupert Murdoch has carried out a huge shake-up of his media empire, and has effectively anointed his son as his successor. </unknownNode><unknownNode>The 34-year-old second son now has responsibility for his European and Asian businesses, so will he wield political influence in the same way as his father, or are we about to witness a change of strategy - Tony Blair famously jetted to Australia to address a News Corp sales conference for Rupert Murdoch &hellip;..

UK interest rates trimmed to 5.5%</unknownNode><unknownNode>Miscarriage of justice? Imagine serving a life sentence for child murder - and being innocent. In 2005 Suzanne Holdsworth was convicted of brutally murdering a toddler - whom she was babysitting when he fell fatally ill. But now new scientific evidence given to Newsnight suggests she might have had nothing at all to do with his death. John Sweeney reports on what could be another miscarriage of justice. Read John Sweeney's article and watch a preview of tonight's film.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Ahead of today's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decision to cut interest rates, last night we assembled our own MPC to discuss the underlying issues amid signs the economy is slowing - falling house prices, fewer mortgages being approved, tumbling consumer confidence and shop windows full of price reductions. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Jeremy was joined by former chancellor Ken Clarke, and expert economists Dr Ruth Lea, Martin Wolf, Dr Irwin Stelzer and our own Stephanie Flanders.</unknownNode><unknownNode>At the end we asked them all to hold up cards to show how they would vote if they were on the MPC. Stephanie, being thoroughly independent, of course declined but she did predict there would be 'no change'. The others were split, two for a 0.25% cut, two for 'no change'.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Following what had been a extraordinarily enlightening and very detailed economic debate, some people thought the vote a bit of a stunt. We rather enjoyed it but what do you think? Did the cards work for you? </unknownNode><unknownNode>Robert Morgan is today's programme producer. Here's his early email to the team.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Good morning,</unknownNode><unknownNode>There are quite a few good stories today.  Home Secretary Jacqui Smith has just announced plans to extend the period that terrorism suspects can be held without charge for up to 42 days.  In an attempt to win over critics, it is planned to give MPs a role in any decision to let police hold suspects for more than the current 28-day limit. </unknownNode><unknownNode>There's the MPC interest rates decision at 12 noon, a new Abrahams story and the canoeist yarn continues. Do come to the meeting armed with ideas on these and other stories.    </unknownNode><unknownNode>We've got a strong film on a new potential miscarriage of justice from John Sweeney and Richard Pattinson.  Doubt cast on baby death verdict - read John's story in full here  </unknownNode><unknownNode>See you in a minute,</unknownNode><unknownNode>Robert </unknownNode><unknownNode>Tonight, what would you do if you were in the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC)?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Would you cut interest rates? And what effect would that have on the economy? </unknownNode><unknownNode>As the MPC meets at the Bank of England we've convened a committee of the great and good of our own.  Jeremy will chair it, with Stephanie to advise him. But in the meantime, do play our Monetary Policy Committee game and let us know what you think.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Also tonight, Jack Straw outlines how he's going to control the prison population. Does this mean asking judges to make the punishment fit the prison places available rather than the crime? Jeremy is putting that point to Jack Straw right now.</unknownNode><unknownNode>As the former chief police officer responsible for roads it is a little embarrassing for Meredydd Hughes to be banned for driving at 90 mph in a 60 mph zone. But he's not the only police officer to have been caught on camera.  Tonight we show over a dozen photos we've obtained using the Freedom of Information Act showing police officers speeding. The difference is that none of these police officers - all members of Meredydd Hughes&rsquo;s South Yorkshire force - have been prosecuted after they refused to say who was driving the car.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Finally, what has happened to the punk violinist Nigel Kennedy? Our culture correspondent, Madeleine Holt has caught up with him in his new home, in Poland.  Join Jeremy tonight at 10.30pm </unknownNode><unknownNode>Simon Enright is today's programme producer, returning to the Newsnight fold after a stint elsewhere in the BBC.

It is PMQs today</unknownNode><unknownNode>Or should we go for an Economy special? I want to hear from Stephanie Flanders ahead of tomorrow's interest rate decision. Could we have a Hawk vs a Dove in debate? Could we have a piece to remind us what the last recession was like?</unknownNode><unknownNode>We could also slip in another 'where are they now' piece. Meirion/Jackie Long have an update on the money raised to help with Tsunami. Remember that? Have the Red Cross finally spent all the money raised three years ago? (Would I be asking that question if they had?)</unknownNode><unknownNode>Finally while Polish plumbers are coming over here you might be surprised to hear who we are exporting to Poland&hellip;Madeleine Holt catches up with violinist and new Polish patriot Nigel Kennedy.</unknownNode><unknownNode>For those of you who don't know me I'm the one with the loud laugh.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Simon</unknownNode><unknownNode>DAVID SOUTHALL</unknownNode><unknownNode>We've just learned that the controversial paediatrician Dr David Southall has been struck off the medical register for serious professional misconduct. Last week the GMC decided he had abused his position by accusing a mother of drugging and murdering her son. John Sweeney was the BBC's investigative reporter who revealed flaws in the case against Sally Clarke. Her verdict was subsequently overturned. Tonight John will be reporting for Newsnight on where this leaves the role of expert witnesses.</unknownNode><unknownNode> HOSTAGES</unknownNode><unknownNode>As I write we are also discussing in the Newsnight office how we will cover the story of the release of a new video by the kidnappers of five Britons who have been held in Iraq since May. In the video the kidnappers demand that Britain withdraws all its forces from Iraq within ten days. The Foreign Office has confirmed that the hostage in the video is one of the British people who were kidnapped. He sat underneath a sign reading &ldquo;The Islamic Shiite Resistance in Iraq&rdquo;. The video has been condemned by the government.</unknownNode><unknownNode> NIMROD</unknownNode><unknownNode>&ldquo;Very thorough and very damning" - that was the reaction of Graham Knight the father of Sergeant Ben Knight, to the report into the Nimrod crash which killed his son and 13 other service personnel when the plane blew up over Afghanistan.  The report concluded a fuel leak was probably to blame and the defence secretary apologised to MPs, victims and their families for &ldquo;failings for which the Ministry of Defence must take responsibility". These planes are still flying because they are a key component of our military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, and allegedly incidents of fuel leaks are continuing in their dozens. I hope to be speaking to a defence minister.</unknownNode><unknownNode> BROKEN BRITAIN</unknownNode><unknownNode>And at this time of year we return to some of the big stories and issues Newsnight has led the way on during the past 12 months. In a series of films we have examined &ldquo;Broken Britain". Tonight we report from Wythenshawe a few miles south of Manchester which was built as a Garden City in the 1920s, but now this post-industrial, largely white working class community is struggling with gangs, knives, drugs and guns.</unknownNode><unknownNode>We are also keen to hear from you - do you think crime is really falling?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Jeremy Paxman bought me dinner last night.  Canap&eacute;s, candlelight, cocktail music..?  Yeah, right.   He thrusts a &pound;20 note at me, its silver strip catching the fierce fluorescents in his office and says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have the meal deal - and get something for yourself&rdquo;. Then with that trademark televisual twinkle in his eye he adds, &lsquo;And don&rsquo;t ever say I don&rsquo;t buy you dinner!&rsquo; The 6.30 food order is something of a NN office ritual.  Nearly everything we do is deadline driven and the idea of downing tools and sloping off somewhere to eat for an hour is a tad quaint.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Angry hacks</unknownNode><unknownNode>OK, we&rsquo;re not talking Victorian children snatching a scoop of porridge at one end of the loom before weaving their way back again.  But you do see harried journos biting off more than they can chew while trying to craft a video package for your later consumption. As the office junior - admittedly one of the Beeb&rsquo;s more senior juniors - it falls on me to place the food order.  You&rsquo;d think that being the Arch-Nourisher of NN would put me in a privileged position, but a hungry man is an angry man and you can&rsquo;t please all of the hacks all of the time.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Get your hands off my falafels</unknownNode><unknownNode>One might be delayed in a legal meeting while another is itching to eat before being stuck in the studio for a pre-show recording.  Added to which, if you don&rsquo;t keep enough people on board there&rsquo;s a danger of losing the free delivery. So many variables, so little time... But it&rsquo;s all in a 13-hour day&rsquo;s work and a newsroom marches on its stomach.  Plus, there&rsquo;s nothing like the wonder in a reporter&rsquo;s eye when those foil food parcels arrive.  It&rsquo;s only slightly tainted as she says, &lsquo;Jeremy - have you got hold of my falafels?&rsquo; Which brings us back to Mr P&rsquo;s proffered &pound;20 note.   I can&rsquo;t prove it, but I swear that under the glare of the strip lights, on the flip side of Her Majesty, Adam Smith&rsquo;s winking at me. </unknownNode><unknownNode>The statistics tell us that crime is falling. Politicians tell us that we are now less likely to become victims of crime.</unknownNode><unknownNode>It&rsquo;s a rosy picture &ndash; but is it accurate?  Are we really safer? Or is crime still an issue which keeps us awake at night? Ahead of our special report from the Wythenshawe estate we&rsquo;d like to hear from you about your experience &ndash; is crime really under control? </unknownNode><unknownNode>Donations - there will be an opposition debate today on party funding, and pressure is increasing on Wendy Alexander and now Peter too.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Nimrod inquiry into crash over Afghanistan in which 14 servicemen died - it was the biggest single loss of life since the Falklands. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Iran - Bush presser this afternoon. Israel disputes the US intelligence assessment. What are the implications of the report for diplomatic relations between US and Iran?</unknownNode><unknownNode>And we have Zaiba Malik's film from Wythenshawe in Greater Manchester. Once a peaceful, prosperous garden city, now like many other estates the area is facing social breakdown, crime and drug abuse. The piece explores how the white working class community there is trying to deal with its problems. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Sudan Gillian Gibbons has been pardoned today by the Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir and in a statement released by the Sudanese presidential palace she said she was sorry if she caused any distress. It's not clear when she will leave Sudan but her release from jail brings to an end Ms Gibbons&rsquo; ordeal but not the story of her conviction. </unknownNode><unknownNode>It has been alleged that the extremity of the response to her class naming a teddy Mohammed had more to do with the British government's outspoken criticism of the Sudanese government's role in Darfur than the school room incident itself.    Tonight we also report from Darfur where nearly two and a half million souls are dotted in camps throughout the area and gunman roam the settlements involved in the ever increasing number of rebel factions. In October alone seven aid workers were shot. We'll be speaking to Mia Farrow one of the most outspoken critics of the Sudanese government who have failed to agree the terms for the new 26,000 UN/ African Union peacekeeping force, possibly delaying its deployment.   Donors We have the results of an exclusive Newsnight poll into whether the government is covered in sleaze and if it's competent. The results makes for really interesting reading.   The Labour donor maelstrom, imaginatively called "Donorgate", is still dominating the news agenda, and our political editor Michael Crick is on the case, while David Grossman is in Scotland where Wendy Alexander is fighting for her political life.  She has said she won't resign as leader of the Labour Party in Scotland - she will await the result of the Electoral Commission report into her acceptance of a donation from an offshore benefactor Paul Green. Is she being kept in position as a "human shield" for Harriet Harman and even the Prime Minister? Gordon Brown's efforts to deflect interest onto his moves to reform in party funding raise more questions again - will the millions handed over by the Trades Unions dry up and if so how will Labour deal with its looming debt mountain?       We hope to be joined by a trade union leader live.    Afghanistan We have a fascinating film from Afghanistan, about the relationship between British officials and tribal chiefs. It's back to the Great Game - British diplomats are following the template working in the same way they did during Victorian times, including being trained to speak Pashtun, apparently with great success.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Canoeist returns John Darwin has walked into a London police station five and a half years after disappearing in the sea in front of his house at Seaton Carew near Hartlepool. But where has he been? And does he remember the moment he went overboard from his red canoe. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Of course his family are delighted he is home safely but how did he spend the intervening five and a half years. His return is a sad reminder to others whose loved ones are still unaccounted for. Such stories of people disappearing into the sea - John Stonehouse and the fictional Reggie Perrin among them - hold a fascination for people. Tonight we'll be examining the impact such accidental and planned disappearances have on the ones they leave behind. </unknownNode><unknownNode>BEIRUT - I was passed a pretty miserable letter this week from a young Egyptian man called Abdel Kareem Suleiman. He&rsquo;s currently serving time in a prison in the northern city of Alexandria.   His letter alleges abuse by the prison&rsquo;s guards.  &ldquo;I have been subjected to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment,&rdquo; he writes.</unknownNode><unknownNode>For anyone who knows anything about Egypt, that's not very surprising, except for this: Abdel Kareem is 23 and behind bars for blogging.</unknownNode><unknownNode> 						Continue reading "Egyptian blogger alleges prison beating" 					</unknownNode><unknownNode>Dodgy donations Now Paul Green, the Jersey based businessman who helped fund Wendy Alexander's uncontested election campaign to lead the Scottish Labour party has released a letter from Ms Alexander.   In it she thanks him for his donation. Given that she addressed the letter to Jersey it casts doubt on her assertion that she thought the money had come via a Glasgow based firm connected with Mr Green.  If she knew the donation came from "offshore" then surely she knew it was an illegal donation? Can she continue as Labour leader in Scotland and was either her brother Douglas Alexander, or the Prime Minister, in the loop on this one? </unknownNode><unknownNode>Meanwhile Harriet Harman, who's due to have a fundraiser, next week in Leicester Square to help with her election campaign debts, is on the rack. The Electoral Commission has contacted Harriet Harman's office to seek clarification of how she funded her election campaign.  As David Grossman reported last night on Newsnight,  only one loan, an overdraft facility for &pound;10,000 taken out in October last year has so far been reported. Is she having such a bash simply to pay back that loan? Michael Crick and Paul Mason are digging deep. Brown denies war over donations </unknownNode><unknownNode>Siberia Imagine living in a town surrounded by hundreds of square miles of frozen forest, which used to serve principally as a place of exile for political dissidents. Khanty-Mansiisk 1,400 east of Moscow has a population of just 60,000 people but now it's Vladimir Putin's show town. It's been allowed to keep the majority of its vast oil revenues and it's a boom town with a state-of-the-art hospital,  university, performing arts school and many shiny new buildings, and a birth rate of twice the national average. People are flocking there even though the temperature can drop in this Siberian province to -40.  Tim Whewell went there  to witness the boom times for himself, in advance of this weekend's Russian elections which Putin is almost certain to win.

Why? I'm told her campaign vastly overspent the donations received during the contest.  One of her team told me they were "deficit financed".  </unknownNode><unknownNode>She's holding a fundraiser at a nightclub in Leicester Square in London next Wednesday.  The invitation says: </unknownNode><unknownNode>"This is the last opportunity to raise funds towards the cost of our very successful campaign"</unknownNode><unknownNode>My question is simple - where will the money raised go?  </unknownNode><unknownNode>Clearly it's not for current expenditure since the contest finished long ago.  If the campaign is paying back loans, then those loans should have been reported within 30 days to the electoral commission.</unknownNode><unknownNode>The Electoral Commission's entry for Harriet Harman only records one loan arrangement - an overdraft facility for &pound;10,000 with Nat West taken out in October 2006.   This lunchtime I filed a series of 11 questions to the Labour Party - I'm still waiting for a response   Here are the questions:</unknownNode><unknownNode>1 How did Harriet Harman fund her campaign for the deputy leadership election?  </unknownNode><unknownNode>2 How much did the  campaign cost to run in total? </unknownNode><unknownNode>3 Is the loan for &pound;10,000 pounds from the National Westminster Bank taken out on the 3rd October 2006 the only loan she has entered into to fund her campaign?</unknownNode><unknownNode>4 Why is she still raising money for a campaign that finished on 22nd June 2007? </unknownNode><unknownNode>5 Where will the money go that is raised at the event planned for 5th December 2007 at Sounds Nightclub in Leicester Square?</unknownNode><unknownNode>6 If the money raised at this event  goes towards settling campaign debts, where are the required records of those debts? </unknownNode><unknownNode>7 Did she borrow money in her own name for the purposes of the campaign without declaring it to the electoral commission as a loan? </unknownNode><unknownNode>8 Did she borrow money against any assets owned jointly with Jack Dromey for the purpose of funding her campaign? </unknownNode><unknownNode>9 Why is Harriet Harman using her office in the House of Commons as a base from which to raise party political funds, in contravention of Parliamentary rules?  (the initiation for her fund raiser on the 5th December invites people to send donations to Charlotte Montague at her office at the House of Commons) </unknownNode><unknownNode>10 Is Charlotte Montague&rsquo;s salary paid from Harriet Harman&rsquo;s MP&rsquo;s allowances? </unknownNode><unknownNode>11 If Charlotte Montague is paid from Harriet Harman&rsquo;s MP&rsquo;s allowances why is she working on Harriet Harman&rsquo;s campaign from Harriet Harman&rsquo;s office at the House of Commons?  Why has she not registered this in the relevant register of interests for MP&rsquo;s staff?  </unknownNode><unknownNode>Met on the Case In the last few minutes the electoral commission has decided to refer the Labour disguised donations affair to the Metropolitan Police "for further investigation."

David Abrahams told us that the man in charge of Labour's fundraising - Jon Mendelsohn - had just written to him personally to thank him for being one of the party's 'strongest supporters' - a revelation that has set a new frenzy of questions and allegations. It is now known that Mendelsohn knew earlier this month that Abrahams was making donations through intermediaries. Michael Crick has spent the day investigating the implications of the latest twists in this on-going saga.

I was told categorically last night, by a Labour spokesperson, that Jon Mendelsohn had never solicited money from Mr Abrahams since he had become Gordon Brown&rsquo;s chief fundraiser. Yet within minutes of Newsnight running that Labour response, and Geoff Hoon repeating it, Mr Abrahams was on the phone quoting a letter &ndash; he says handwritten, Mendelsohn says typed &ndash; from Mr Mendelsohn, which he says was an implicit request for cash.</unknownNode><unknownNode> 						Continue reading "Three unanswered questions for Jon Mendelsohn" 					</unknownNode><unknownNode>Robert Morgan is Wednesday's programme producer.

Other stories could include Pakistan, the state of the World economy and Kosovo. Any light stories out there for a discussion?</unknownNode><unknownNode>What do you think we should cover?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Party Funding The row over David Abrahams&rsquo;s donations to the Labour Party has deepened. But just who knew what about Mr Abrahams&rsquo;s funding and when? Harriet Harman seems to be in trouble after it was revealed that her campaign did take money from Janet Kidd, one of Mr. Abrahams&rsquo;s intermediaries. This is made more embarrassing because the Prime Minister&rsquo;s own leadership campaign rejected a donation from the same source and Hilary Benn also turned down the cash because it wasn't in David Abraham's own name. In the interests of transparency there will be an enquiry but the person commissioning it is none other than&hellip;Harriet Harman.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Middle East The talks about talks continue in Annapolis, Maryland on attempts to reach agreement on a peace plan for the Middle East.

Peter Watt admitted he had known that a major donor to the party had paid his money through intermediaries - but not that this might have been illegal.

Virgin is the preferred bidder for Northern Rock. Why - you may wonder - in an open capitalist system, is anyone the preferred bidder? And why - you may equally wonder - are people criticising Virgin for getting a bargain? (Prompting the thought: if Britain's most notorious bank is such a bargain, sunshine, why don't YOU buy it?) All will be clear by 10.30 tonight. Virgin's Rock bid 'to be blocked'</unknownNode><unknownNode>Oxford Union As I write this protests are expected at the Freedom of Speech debate at the Oxford Union tonight because the Union has chosen to invite the BNP's Nick Griffin and the historian (and ex jailbird) David Irving.

Northern Rock has chosen the Virgin Group as its preferred buyer. Virgin's offer - which has been backed by the Treasury - includes an immediate repayment of &pound;11bn of the &pound;25bn the bank owes the Bank of England. Private Equity businessmen have already expressed "shock" at what they regard as a very generous deal for Branson. So how fair is this deal for the taxpayer?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Brown Gordon Brown has just given a speech outlining his plans to "intensify compulsion in the benefits system." New briefings are promised on welfare reform today. Is this just a reannouncement of existing policy to grab a quick headline, or something more interesting?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Labour donor How could a jobbing builder and secretary in Newcastle contribute nearly &pound;400,000 to Labour Party funds? Because it was "given" to them by a publicity shy property developer, that's how. This was clearly an unusual  practice and potentially against the law, but is it even more serious than that? Did anybody in the Labour Party know about this unusual arrangement? </unknownNode><unknownNode>Middle East peace The Annapolis conference begins tomorrow, there are talks at the White House today. Peter Marshall is there for us.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Oxford debate There's a freedom of speech debate at the Oxford Union tonight. David Irving and Nick Griffin have been invited.

The administration that would break away from the spin of previous years, do no serious wrong, excite us little. But the events of the past few days have shown us a government that has been far from boring. And indeed, you could argue, far from competent. Perhaps you wouldn&rsquo;t even need to argue that at all. Tonight we ask how much the fiascos of the past weeks have been specifically of Gordon Brown's own making. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Have the moves he made at the Treasury now come back to haunt him?

But our report this evening looks at one small business there that stands accused of exploiting migrant labour. Long hours, dangerous conditions with people who are so desperately grateful to find any sort of work they are loath to complain. This is no third world factory, this is a little corner of England. So why has no one clamped down before now? </unknownNode><unknownNode>The price of privacy We may get outraged when the government loses details of our bank accounts and our children's names in the post. But how much are we exposing ourselves anyway in the things we sign up to on a daily basis. Whether they're supermarket club cards, social networking sites or webpage services we part with information pretty readily these days. It's all big bucks for the businesses involved. But what's the actual cost to us? Our Economics Editor Stephanie Flanders will be taking a look.   Newsnight Review John Wilson is joined by Tom Paulin, Tony Parsons and Julie Myerson to discuss not one but two new Kenneth Branagh films - Sleuth and The Magic Flute.

The prime minister said he wanted to be remembered not just for competence but also for his vision. He must be wondering now whether he spoke too soon. After an autumn of damaging stories starting with the election that never was, then Northern Rock and now this latest crisis is the government's reputation for competence ebbing away?

A car park was the venue for an event staged by a new campaign called &ldquo;Khalass!&rdquo; &ndash; Arabic for &ldquo;Enough!&rdquo;   Concertgoers desperately want their politicians to resolve Lebanon&rsquo;s latest political standoff.  The country&rsquo;s constitution requires the election of a new President by November 24th.  As the days pass, compromise between Lebanon&rsquo;s pro-Western/anti-Syrian government and pro-Syrian/Hizbullah-dominated opposition seems distant.  No acceptable candidate has been found and the election has been delayed three times.

The big shift they think has happened as a result of last week&rsquo;s revelations about the numbers of foreign workers employed in the UK over the past decade. The current official estimate is 1.5 million.  Parliamentary answer 18 July 2007</unknownNode><unknownNode> Over the same period it appears that the number of welfare claimants has fallen hardly at all. According to the former welfare reform minister Frank Field: </unknownNode><unknownNode>"The economy has been growing each quarter since late 1992 but the numbers of working age claimants moving into work has been modest. I calculate the numbers have fallen from only 5.7 to 5.4 million. The government asserts the total is 4.7 million. The independent Statistics Commission has been asked to arbitrate.</unknownNode><unknownNode>"Yet, whatever the outcome, the spotlight will be on the failure of the &pound;84 billion welfare to work programme.&rdquo;  Frank Field MP - Daily Telegraph 3 November 2007</unknownNode><unknownNode>The big question that the Conservatives now think the public is asking is a simple one:</unknownNode><unknownNode>&ldquo;How come all these foreign workers can find jobs in the British economy when so many British people seem stuck on welfare?&rdquo; </unknownNode><unknownNode>Before the clock ran out on him Tony Blair was desperate to push through changes, perhaps sensing that he hadn&rsquo;t done enough on welfare reform in the past. He appointed David Freud to propose radical reform.  Mr Blair predicted this review would throw up some pretty difficult political challenges for the government.   He told the House of Commons Liaison committee on 6 February 2007:</unknownNode><unknownNode>&ldquo;When we publish David Freud's Welfare Reform Programme.......there will be some quite difficult proposals in relation to how people come off benefit and into work - lone parents, people on incapacity benefit and so on.&rdquo; </unknownNode><unknownNode>So it proved. The Freud report recommended a radical shake up of the welfare system. Contracting out welfare to work programmes to all sorts of organisations, including private sector providers, who will be paid by results.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>Gordon Brown&rsquo;s government has so far not fully embraced the Freud Report - Peter Hain MP, the Work and Pensions Secretary told an audience in September:</unknownNode><unknownNode>&ldquo;I have yet to be convinced that David&rsquo;s specific proposal based around 11 regional contacts, thereby replacing a one-size-fits all state monopoly approach, with a one-size-fits all private monopoly approach is the answer.&rdquo; Peter Hain MP 12 September 2007. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Wisconsin </unknownNode><unknownNode>This kind of welfare reform is already commonplace in the United States. Wisconsin led the way in the mid-90s.</unknownNode><unknownNode> Under the then Republican Governor Tommy Thompson the state cut out cash welfare benefits almost entirely, instead the money was spent on helping people find work. In his conference speech this year David Cameron praised what had been achieved in Wisconsin: </unknownNode><unknownNode>&ldquo;....where they've cut benefit roles (sic)  by 80%, and the changes we will make are these: we will say to people that if you are offered a job and it's a fair job and one that you can do and you refuse it you shouldn't get any welfare.&rdquo;</unknownNode><unknownNode>Having seen the Wisconsin system in action I have a few thoughts on the chances of introducing it in the UK:</unknownNode><unknownNode>1.  In America it only worked because both parties signed up to it.  Although the idea came from the Republican Party, it took Bill Clinton, a Democrat trying to connect with working class Republicans to sell it nationwide. </unknownNode><unknownNode>It is the first law of public service reform that the People who think they will lose out under any change usually have more motivation to make a lot of noise.  This includes not just the recipients of welfare under the current system but also the public sector employees (and their unions) who administer the current system. If all political parties are signed up to the changes then there is less chance that one or other party will backtrack in the face of hostile headlines.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>2.   In America the politicians managed to change the way the public thought about welfare.  It was no longer seen as cruel or mean to cut someone&rsquo;s welfare in order to force them to get a job. In fact thinking changed 180 degrees. It was actually seen as cruel to keep someone on welfare a day longer than necessary.  The only way out of poverty is through work, not bigger, more generous handouts. Although many British voters have started to ask questions about welfare it&rsquo;s by no means clear that the link in the public&rsquo;s mind between cutting benefits and &ldquo;meanness&rdquo; has been broken.  If people suspect that the motivation for welfare reform is purely to save money it becomes a far harder political sell.  It only worked in the US because voters became convinced it was a better system for everyone including the welfare recipients themselves.   </unknownNode><unknownNode>3.   The American system relies on a huge and well-resourced charitable sector.  In Wisconsin I went to the amazing  Open Door Cafe at the Cathedral of St John the Evangelist in Milwaukee. Here volunteers  provide over 200 hot meals a day, six days a week for homeless people.  It appeared to me that many of the people who use the service are not really in a position to get a job however much the welfare system &ldquo;incentivises&rdquo; them.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>They have in the jargon &ldquo;multiple barriers to work&rdquo; for example mental health problems, drug or alcohol dependency, and are often illiterate. Someone needs to help these people if the state withdraws from providing a universal right to welfare benefits. All British political parties say they want to beef up the voluntary sector in the UK but we are nowhere near American levels of charitable action.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>What happens now?</unknownNode><unknownNode>The Conservatives are set to publish their proposals on welfare reform early in the new year.</unknownNode><unknownNode>The government&rsquo;s green paper In Work Better off: Next Steps to Full Employment was published in July.  The consultation period on it has just finished.  It&rsquo;s not yet clear when and even if the government will introduce a new welfare reform bill.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Watch David Grossman&rsquo;s film about Welfare in Wisconsin here</unknownNode><unknownNode>In the latest entry into the Newsnight bookclub, businessman Sir Ronald Cohen offers budding entrepreneurs guidance on how to approach the challenges and opportunities ahead of them.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Sir Ronald Cohen speaks to Newsnight on Wednesday, 7 November. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Extract from The Second Bounce of the Ball: Turning Risk into Opportunity by Ronald Cohen published by Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson at &pound;20.00.</unknownNode><unknownNode>There is a clich&eacute; that entrepreneurs are born, not made. If I think back on my experience, I know this is not entirely true.

The most contentious proposal will involve terrorism, with ministers considering doubling the limit when suspects can be held without charge from 28 days to 56.

Mr King said Lloyds TSB had wanted a &pound;30bn loan from the Bank of England at competitive rates as part of the deal.  The collapse of the deal meant that Northern Rock had to go to the Bank of England for emergency funding.  "I said to the chancellor: 'This is not something which a central bank can do'.

They are radicalising, indoctrinating and grooming young, vulnerable people to carry out acts of terrorism."  These are the words of the Director General of the Security Service.  His audience? Oh, just a bunch of newspaper editors.  A write up on the PA news wires later, and guess what tonight's headline is in the London Evening Standard? "The Teenage Terrorists."  So the timing ahead of the Queen's speech may be a little suspect, and the newspaper reaction may have been calculated, but is the head of MI5 right? How widespread is the "grooming" of young people for terrorism? We speak to the head of a children's charity who says she has had to intervene to stop her young charges from becoming radicalised, and we have a live interview with a former - and senior - member of a radical Muslim organisation.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Pakistan</unknownNode><unknownNode>So the Elections in Pakistan will go ahead after all in January, Musharraf's Government said today, but can we believe them? What has been the pressure behind the scenes from Washington. Were the West right to invest so much in the General all along? We'll speak to politicians in Pakistan and the US.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Queen's speech</unknownNode><unknownNode>Can Gordon Brown seize the initiative in tomorrow's Queen's Speech and set out a vision for his Government?

Michael Crick has been on the case.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Beer rebranding</unknownNode><unknownNode>Finally, we have a fascinating film from Jackie Long on the attempts of Stella Artois to rebrand its beer, as it tries to shed its nickname as the "wife beater&rsquo;s drink of choice".</unknownNode><unknownNode>Tonight, with Jeremy at 10.30. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Doubtless you cynical lot all thought it was terribly funny when the newly enthroned Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, James Purnell, his lips still moist with admonitions to the media not to make stuff up, was caught being photoshopped into a photo pretending to show him visiting a hospital along with a group of MPs. </unknownNode><unknownNode>The truth was that he turned up late and had to be photographed separately. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Here's the original press release of the event and here's the rather crudely doctored photo that was released along with it.</unknownNode><unknownNode/><unknownNode>Fortunately for Mr Purnell there was no proof that he knew of the deception. He had posed for the photograph, he said, under the innocent impression that it would be presented seperately.  It was all a terrible misunderstanding with the hapless hospital trust.</unknownNode><unknownNode>At this point we must pause to praise Tameside Hospital, whose interpretation of the Freedom of Information Act make them a model of openness and integrity, and strong contenders for the National Transparency Award, if such a thing exists. </unknownNode><unknownNode>They promptly offered up every piece of evidence requested of them in this strange case, allowing puzzled hacks to get nearer to the bottom of things.</unknownNode><unknownNode>So courtesy of the FOI Act, here is Mr Purnell, posing on his own so that he can be dropped into the photoshopped image. </unknownNode><unknownNode/><unknownNode>The width of the shot leaves us in little doubt what was in the photographer's mind for the photo. But the positioning of Mr Purnell right in front of the camera would have given the unfortunate minister no clue about those intentions. Scandal rating: low</unknownNode><unknownNode>Then the hosptial also told us the name of the photographer, a very nice chap named Matt. Great, we thought. A potential whistle blower.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>Michael Crick got onto him on the phone, but Matt rather wisely decided he didn't need the hassle of talking to us on camera. But off tape, he really wouldn't put his hand on his heart and say the minister knew that he was going to be doctored into the pictures. Scandal rating: still low.</unknownNode><unknownNode>However, he did mention that there were some other pictures taken inside the hospital. So thanks to FOI, here they are. </unknownNode><unknownNode/><unknownNode>As you can see here the photoshopping of this picture is markedly worse than previously and could have fooled no-one. </unknownNode><unknownNode/><unknownNode> There's also another shot of Mr Purnell posing solo here. This time he is standing away to the left, but possibly still not far enough offset for him to question the fact that the camera is not  pointing straight at him. </unknownNode><unknownNode>We also got a second doctored photo taken outside, without the hospital chief executive present, which uses the same shot of Mr Purnell. All very entertaining but still no story for us though.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Then an apparent breakthrough. The papers cleverly FOI-ed all the emails between the hospital and Mr Purnell, which you can read here, here and here. Had we been beaten to the headline?</unknownNode><unknownNode>One email was sent almost a month before publication to Mr Purnell from the hospital's chief executive, saying "I was pleased we were able to catch the photographer so that we could 'drop you into the photographs'." </unknownNode><unknownNode>Precisely what that meant we don't really know. Why the quote marks? In any case Mr Purnell's reported response to the newspapers was that he hadn't seen that email until it was too late.</unknownNode><unknownNode>The same goes for the email containing the photographs themselves, sent a couple of days before the press release went out.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Scandal rating:  embarrassing, but hardly a hanging offence</unknownNode><unknownNode>There was one last chance to get a story, and justify the hours wasted on this (in this journalist's spare time, licence payers will be pleased to hear). </unknownNode><unknownNode>We FOI-ed the read receipts on the emails. If we could show when those emails had been opened and read and by who, that might at least suggest more detail of who in Mr Purnell's office knew what and when. Or something.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>Anyway here's the FOI response. A big fat zero. No such receipts exist. Mr Purnell's version of events stands up to the closest scrutiny we could manage. His scalp remains firmly on his head and not on our wall. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Still, maybe there's a web article in it.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Photographer: Matt Priestley </unknownNode><unknownNode>Continuing with our experiment that began last week, we're sharing the early thoughts of our production team and asking for your ideas as to what Newsnight should be covering tonight.

The Met Commissioner, Sir Ian Blair is confidently sticking to script, insisting he can and will stay in the post after the guilty verdict on the De Menezes shooting. But what's going on behind the scenes? Are there forces - no pun intended - at work to make him change his mind? And more importantly, perhaps, just how will this verdict affect the way this country is policed in future? The Mayor of London fears we could end up with a force so bogged down in health and safety regulations it loses the ability to act in our best interest. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Northern Rock</unknownNode><unknownNode>Each British taxpayer has essentially had to stump up &pound;730 a head - through Bank of England loans - to keep this business going. On top of that, the treasury has also indemnified a further &pound;20 billion of deposits. The burden of responsibility this places on the Chancellor is huge. Is it a price worth paying if it saves the system from collapse? For how long can it realistically continue? What are the alternatives for the Bank of England and the Chancellor?  </unknownNode><unknownNode>Immigration</unknownNode><unknownNode>The immigration picture in this country is pretty baffling. Not least, it's emerged this week, to the Home Office. But tonight, we examine how this country looks from the other side. If you're an immigrant is it an easy, attractive, welcoming place to live? We ask those who've come to live in Britain from Poland, Afghanistan, Iraq and Nigeria. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Thanks very much for all the suggestions on the blog, some of which we've managed to reflect.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Today&rsquo;s output editor is Robert Morgan &ndash; here are his early thoughts about how to fill tonight&rsquo;s half hour....</unknownNode><unknownNode> Good morning,</unknownNode><unknownNode>I'm genuinely open to any new ideas today.

The Conservatives and Liberal Democrats are now calling for the head of the Met, Sir Ian Blair. Before the trial started, Sir Ian said that if found guilty "the implications for operational policing in the UK would be profound". So what went wrong? We'll be looking at the judge's conclusions and discuss what they mean for Sir Ian and the future of policing in this country.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>IMMIGRATION</unknownNode><unknownNode>Many Newsnight bloggers were keen for us to look at the effects of immigration. The LGA have said it needs an extra &pound;250 million a year to cope with the added numbers using public services.  We've sent Paul Mason to Slough to see what the local feelings are towards immigration and will try to make sense of the many statistics used on both sides of the debate. David Cameron has called for a limit on immigration, but is this practical, or desirable? We'll be debating in the studio.</unknownNode><unknownNode>PAKISTAN    Pakistani President, Pervez Musharraf, is still waiting to discover the Supreme Court's decision on whether his election win back in October is legal. He's also facing a wave of Islamist violence, the latest being a suicide bomber who killed eight Pakistani air force personnel earlier today.

Let's just imagine a parallel universe where an election had been called, what would have happened in the campaign - would Labour be struggling to keep their majority, or heading for a clear victory? It's a good chance to see how the British political scene has changed in the last three weeks. We have a panel of political grandees who have seen it all before - Ken Clarke, Charles Kennedy and Roy Hattersley.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Child Labour and Cotton</unknownNode><unknownNode>We have a follow up to last night's extraordinary film by Simon Ostrovsky into the cotton industry in Uzbekistan. The film showed child labour picking cotton for very little money. Some of the cotton is eventually used in clothing sold by major retail outlets in the UK. Simon has spoken to Britain's high street chains and asked for their reaction to his report; we'll reveal what they said.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Cancer - A report too far?</unknownNode><unknownNode>On the Newsnight website today, some of you said you were interested in the report by the World Cancer Research Fund into the links between lifestyle and cancer. Their recommendations seem pretty tough - try not to gain weight as an adult, avoid sugary drinks, alcohol and bacon. Do these reports do any good or are they counter-productive?

An investigation for tonight&rsquo;s  programme has found that the government of Uzbekistan uses  forced child labour to pick cotton &ndash; and that cotton often finds its way into clothes sold in British stores such as Asda, Matalan and Burton. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Uzbekistan is the world&rsquo;s second largest exporter of cotton, a trade which is controlled by the State, and merchants claim that ninety per cent of its output is hand picked. Human rights groups estimate some 450,000 children are shut out of schools and working in its cotton fields every harvest, despite the government&rsquo;s stance that child labour is outlawed.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>We'll be speaking to the Trade and Development minister, Gareth Thomas about what can be done to stop this.      </unknownNode><unknownNode>IMMIGRATION   Also tonight after the apology by one but two government ministers about the substantial underestimate of the numbers of migrant workers who have arrived in the UK since 1997. Now after some close reading of the revised statistics it appears that more than   half of the new jobs created in the past decade have been taken by foreign workers.  W here does that leave Gordon Brown's rallying cry at the TUC conference - British jobs for British people?   CHAD</unknownNode><unknownNode>The authorities in Chad have charged nine French citizens, some of them from the French organisation Zoe's Ark,   with abduction and fraud, accusing them of trying to smuggle more than a hundred children to Europe. Zoe's Ark claims the children are orphans from the Darfur region of Sudan, Chadian officials said most appeared to be from Chad. The news raises the issue of international child adoption and the risks inherent in it. We'll be discussing that tonight. Remember the furore over Madonna's adoption of a little Malawian boy? Other celebrities have opted for children from abroad, and many ordinary families too. Is it  ever a good idea to adopt or foster children from their home country?

Today oil prices are sky high - $93 a barrel - that's 40% up on the figure at the start of the year, and four times the price five years ago. Oil is pretty close to the prices it hit during the oil shock in the early 1980s. Stephanie Flanders will be looking at why oil is so expensive right now.  And we'll be discussing if the answer could be the hydrogen fuel car.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Phone innovation   And somebody's paying for the new 3 Skype-phone but who is it? Paul Mason dials up the communication revolution which allows Skype users to make free Internet calls to each other while on the move. The phone which marries Skype and the mobile phone company 3 is being launched in nine markets including Britain, Australia and Italy. There are already 246 million strong registered users, so where does this fit into the technology arc, what impact will this have on the communications industry, and how quickly will there be yet another innovation? </unknownNode><unknownNode>Newsnight Review</unknownNode><unknownNode>Kwame Kwei-Armah is joined by Julie Myerson, Bidisha and Michael Gove.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Elizabeth: The Golden Age Nearly ten years on from her Oscar nominated performance, Cate Blanchett resumes the role of Elizabeth.

The latest, called DNA Low Copy Number, can pick out the DNA from just a single human cell at a crime scene or on a weapon. But this technique, the technique at the heart of two high profile cases - the Omagh bombing in Northern Ireland and the disappearance of Madeleine McCann - is itself under scrutiny.

When her identity was published in a newspaper column four years ago, she was an undercover agent for the CIA. And when an investigation traced the leak of her name all the way to the White House, it became apparent this was no ordinary spy story. Her cover was blown after her husband, a former ambassador named Joe Wilson, criticized the White House about the Iraq war.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Watch tonight for the first UK broadcast interview with Valerie Plame - and read an extract from her book Fair Game. Part of the Newsnight Book Club.</unknownNode><unknownNode>LLOYD GEORGE  As a statue of David Lloyd George is unveiled, opinion on Britain's World War I prime minister continues to be divided. In a letter to the Daily Telegraph ahead of the unveiling, playwright Harold Pinter, journalist John Pilger and former UN humanitarian co-ordinator for Iraq, Denis Halliday, criticise its existence. They say that during his tenure - between 1916 and 1922 - he ordered bombing in Afghanistan, Iraq and Iran. But Lloyd George supporters praise him for leading the country to victory in World War I and say he was a pioneer for establishing the first stage of a welfare state. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Liberal Democrat leadership candidate, Chris Huhne, regards Lloyd George as his political hero.

What? I struggled to wake up. I sat up, switched on the lamp, and opened the Washington Post to the op-ed page; I didn&rsquo;t know what I would find, but I knew it wouldn&rsquo;t be good. Robert Novak had written in his column that &ldquo;Wilson never worked for the CIA, but his wife, Valerie Plame, is an Agency operative on weapons of mass destruction.&rdquo; The words were right there on the page, in black and white, but I could not take them in. I felt like I had been sucker-punched, hard, in the gut. Although we had known for several days that he had my name and knew where I worked, we never believed for a moment he would actually print it or that the Agency would allow it.

Also in the programme:    Turkey   The Turkish Prime Minister is on his way to London as rebels of the Kurdish group the PKK kill more Turkish soldiers. The Turkish army is champing at the bit to strike back into the PKK heartland in northern Iraq.  Nobody disputes Turkey's right to defend itself and its citizens - so what can be done?

The Party's holding its congress in Beijing this week with ringing edicts from President Hu Jintao about creating a harmonious society. What he means is that Chinese society is anything but harmonious. For 30 years, coastal China has been allowed to run ahead of the brooding hinterland of subsistence farmers. And now the divisions of wealth are alarming. White Horse Village is the China that is supposed to get help. When we started our series there 16 months ago, we were told the village would be transformed into a city within three years but the miracle has not worked completely in the village. Carrie Gracie reports on the third in our series on White Horse Village. </unknownNode><unknownNode>On Wednesday BBC director general Mark Thompson submits plans for the corporation's future to the governing body, the BBC Trust.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Staff will hear of his proposals on Thursday - but it is rumoured they will include  up to 2,800 jobs cuts as Thompson attempts to deal with a &pound;2bn budget shortfall caused by a smaller than hoped-for licence fee settlement.</unknownNode><unknownNode>BBC News and factual TV - which makes programmes such as Planet Earth - are expected to bear the brunt of the cuts. The corporation may even sell Television Centre, its landmark west London studio complex.</unknownNode><unknownNode>What do these changes mean for the future of the BBC? Has it become too big - does its influence across television, radio and online need to be curbed? Or is there a risk that more staff cuts, especially in news and documentaries, may damage the BBC's central purpose - public service broadcasting?</unknownNode><unknownNode>John Curtice, Professor of Politics at Strathclyde University, assesses the problems facing the Liberal Democrats in the wake of Sir Menzies Campbell's resignation.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Sir Menzies has complained about always being asked about his age. Doubtless this was both irritating and debilitating. But in truth his age in years was not his problem. It was rather that in his manner he seemed from a different age - and as a result distant from the public he was seeking to represent. And in the end it was apparent inability to reach out to the wider public that was his undoing.</unknownNode><unknownNode>When last month MORI asked, as it does every month, how satisfied people were with how Sir Menzies was doing the job of Liberal Democrat leader,  11% more people said they were dissatisfied than satisfied. But that was not the most telling statistic. Rather it was that despite having been in the job for 18 months, as many as 41% could not say whether they were satisfied or dissatisfied.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Until a couple of weeks ago, however, this problem was not terminal for Sir Menzies. While down on the 19% average poll rating he had inherited as leader, his party was still running at 17% at the time of his party's conference last month.  Meanwhile the fizz had apparently gone out David Cameron's leadership of the Conservatives.</unknownNode><unknownNode>But the Tory revival following the party's successful conference produced a precipitate fall in Liberal Democrat support to just 12%. At the same time David Cameron's personal popularity was restored. It was now vital that the LIberal Democrats be lead by a popular personality who could make an impact. It is perhaps an indication of Sir Menzies' acute political judgement that he recognised that requirement - and that he was not the person best able to meet it.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Now the Liberal Democrats face two tough tasks. First, can they find a leader who can provide their party with a strategic direction and sell it to the public? The two main contenders, Nick Clegg and Chris Huhne, were both only first elected in 2005. Chris Huhne's leadership bid last time around apart, neither has had little chance to demonstrate that they have this ability. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Second, can the party put losing two leaders in two years behind it? Might the public not conclude that if the Liberal Democrats cannot agree who should be their leader they cannot possibly be trusted to run the country? Whoever wins the leadership will have to address that question convincingly if their victory is not to become a poisoned chalice.</unknownNode><unknownNode> EUROPE As European leaders prepare for their summit in Portugal later this week pressure is increasing on Gordon Brown as he tries to deflect calls for a referendum on the European Reform Treaty.  His ability to maintain this position depends on the so called "red lines" or opt outs Britain has negotiated. But how red and how thick are those lines? The Foreign Secretary is appearing before the ominous sounding EU Scrutiny Select Committee.  Which, as the title suggests have been looking in detail at exactly what has been agreed. If David Miliband doesn't succeed in convincing the committee that the opt outs are legally robust, where does this leave the calls for a referendum?</unknownNode><unknownNode>LIBERAL DEMOCRATS After Menzies Campbell's sudden resignation as leader of the Liberal Democrats last night he's said today he feels "irritated and frustrated" at not being able to lead his party into a General Election.  The challenge now for the Liberal Democrats, as leadership contenders take soundings from supporters, is how it can carve out a distinct identity when Gordon Brown and David Cameron are also concentrating on the centre ground. We'll be talking to two key Liberal Democrats from different strands of the party on which direction the Lib Dems need to take to reverse its fortunes.

Tonight Newsnight reveals that three-quarters of voters do not believe that Gordon Brown has lived up to his promise to bring about a new era of spin-free politics. And a majority of those who took part in the survey believe that Labour pinched ideas from the Conservatives for Alistair Darling's pre-budget report on Tuesday.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>Check our new Big Fat Newsnight Politics Page for full details.</unknownNode><unknownNode>We'll be asking Polly Toynbee of The Guardian and Anatole Kaletsky of The Times what's gone wrong for Gordon Brown and if he can repair the political damage. </unknownNode><unknownNode>GORE WINS NOBEL PRIZE  The former American vice president Al Gore has been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to warn the world about the dangers posed by global warming.

As is well known he&rsquo;s a keen  fan of the game, having played in his youth and lost the sight in one eye after a Rugby injury.  I actually sat in front of him during the England V Scotland semi-final of the 1991 Rugby World Cup.  In order that I can show off a photo I have of this event I'm going to shamelessly borrow someone else's idea.   (Well if Alistair Darling can do it...)   Adapting a contest from Newsnight Political Panellist Daniel Finkelstein&rsquo;s fantastic Comment Central blog, I want to launch a &ldquo;Brown and Me&rdquo; photo competition.  Obviously this can&rsquo;t be a real competition as we in the BBC are not allowed to run any for the time being.  It will have to be a notional competition where everyone wins, even those who don&rsquo;t take part.  So send in your photos saying where and when it was taken.  The best will appear here*.</unknownNode><unknownNode>*If there are no entries BBC Newsnight reserves the right to quietly drop the idea and never mention it again and probably blame Daniel Finkelstein for coming up with such a duff idea in the first place.</unknownNode><unknownNode>A remarkable new documentary from the BBC&rsquo;s Storyville strand once again prompted me to ask the question: what turns a British citizen into a potential suicide bomber, mentally prepared to murder fellow civilians to &ldquo;please&rdquo; God and further an Islamist cause?</unknownNode><unknownNode>There are many factors at work: religious conviction, alienation (but not poverty), and the secrecy and seduction of being part of an anti-establishment cult.

It was controversially referred to OFCOM by the West Midlands police, who claimed that the quotes "were a complete distortion." Peter Marshall has got hold of the transcript which suggests otherwise. Off the record, police sources have given him some fascinating comments. Was the local force trying to appease local radicals?

But for a group of Iraqis, scattered around the Middle East, the statement provided some long awaited hope.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Newsnight was first to report the death threats facing Iraqis who worked for the British military in Basra and at the British Embassy in Baghdad (read about it here and watch the report).  Regarded as collaborators with the enemy, many have felt forced to flee to neighbouring Syria and Jordan.  Unable to work in their new homes, they live off rapidly diminshing savings and fear deportation by the police.   Since Newsnight covered the story others have followed, including The Times which has run a number of articles campaigning on the issue. Today the Prime Minister announced the Government's response.  Iraqi staff who are still working for the British and who have served for 12 months will be able to apply for financial support to aid resettlement elsewhere in Iraq or in the Middle East.  In certain circumstances - yet to be defined - they will be entitled to admission to the UK.   Professional staff, including the translators and administrators interviewed by Newsnight, who left employment since the start of 2005 will be entitled to the same assistance.   This will be welcomed by the Iraqi refugees.  Many don't want asylum in Britain.  They want to stay in Syria or Jordan until it is safe to return and to help rebuild Iraq.  But they need assistance to live in countries where the cost of living is five times that in Iraq.   However, there are plenty of questions about how Brown's proposals will work.  I interviewed Jassim in Damascus earlier in the year.  His name has been changed to protect his identity.  He worked for the British military in Basra since 2003.  "It's a good decision," he said, welcoming Brown's announcement.  "But there are thousands and thousands of Iraqis who worked for the British."   He's sceptical about how such assistance can be administered.  Along with other Iraqis, he has been refused entry to the British Embassy in Damascus.  The Embassy's consular section has been closed for some time.  But more Iraqi refugees live in Damascus than anywhere else in the world.  Will the British be able to cope with the applications for assistance that they are sure to receive?</unknownNode><unknownNode>From tonight&rsquo;s presenter Gavin Esler:</unknownNode><unknownNode>What next? It's been a busy day for the Prime Minister. Michael Crick will be assessing Gordon Brown's performance at his press conference, and in the Commons.

On average the party's lead over the Conservatives since Mr Brown became leader was running at around six points. That could well have been enough for a three figure majority. But it was not sufficiently far above the four point lead Mr Brown needed to be sure of emulating the 66 majority Mr Blair won in 2005.

Our programme has been picking up signs today that Downing Street may be wobbling over calling an election next week. With two opinion polls set to publish tonight we ask has Gordon Brown lost his appetite for an early election? We'll be investigating and getting political reaction live.     Health Gordon Brown was just ten days into the job of PM when he announced a major NHS review headed by Lord Darzi, the then new health minister. Today he produced his interim findings, and unveiled his new title. Lord Darzi will become "Champion of Innovation" - there's to be new patient friendly GP hours, greater infections control - in particular over MRSA - and a better productivity measure. But so far it's hard to work out whether Lord Darzi reckons the extra millions already poured into the Health Service have had any real impact on patient care. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Both the government and the opposition say that  the NHS will be a major battleground in the next elections - whenever that may be. We'll be debating the Darzi report, not with Lord Darzi who is unavailable but with a Health Minister, and his Conservative and liberal democrat opposites.   NHS review targets GPs and bugs</unknownNode><unknownNode>Political trends We'll also have an exclusive interview with  major US political strategist Mark Penn about his new book Microtrends.

But the timing and the manner of his statement has provoked a major political row. First, the PM's suggestion that 1,000 troops would be leaving by Christmas had to be "clarified", as the departure of 500 of those had already been announced. And then, at their conference in Blackpool, a series of Tories accused Gordon Brown of trying to distract attention from their proceedings there, asking why the announcement hadn't been made to parliament.

But more on that later in the programme...</unknownNode><unknownNode>Timing will certainly be crucial to the call of an election. And tonight we'll be doing pretty much what we imagine Mr Brown will be doing this weekend. Consolidating the myriad polls, mountains of advice, and conflicting external factors to tell him on what date he should go to the country if he goes for a snap election.    We'll speak to a panel who know all about giving political advice - and ask them just how much is left to chance in these decisions.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Burma</unknownNode><unknownNode>What would it take to complete a full scale revolution in Burma?

Tell us here.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>From tonight's presenter, Jeremy Paxman:</unknownNode><unknownNode>Where to begin in attempting to describe to you the unalloyed joy that is the Newsnight team's lot in covering party conferences?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Imagine an underground car park. Now fill it with temporary desks and chairs, laptops, televisions and phones. Then cover the desks in a delightful collection of old newspapers, plastic bags and filthy fast food containers. Scent the air with the aroma of many overheated people and a lot of decaying food.</unknownNode><unknownNode>You begin to conjure up the BBC office. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Now add the dilemma facing the staff. These events ceased to have much political significance years ago. When they made party policy they mattered. Now they're just a very expensive series of rallies. </unknownNode><unknownNode>So, welcome to my world. </unknownNode><unknownNode>The most remarkable thing, of all, however, is what seems to have happened to the delegates. I believe that embalmers remove the blood from corpses before they fill them with preserving fluid.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Well, something similar seems to have happened here. All passion has vanished. There are things called &ldquo;debates&rdquo; happening. But they lack that critical factor in discussion, which is a difference of opinion. Mostly what happens is that someone gets the nod from the chair, goes to the microphone and makes an appeal to the leadership or the party. Then they sit down and someone else has a go. Then the bigwig responsible - or sometimes a group of bigwigs - takes the microphone for a much longer period.</unknownNode><unknownNode>This morning we had David Miliband on foreign policy. Actually, although he delivered his first Foreign Secretary's speech to conference as if he was the school swot being asked to talk at Speech Day, he had some rather interesting things to say.</unknownNode><unknownNode>The most charged event of the last 10 years of Labour foreign policy has been the Iraq War. The hundreds of thousands of dead there aren't - of course - being debated in Bournemouth. So we've just staged our own Iraq debate, which you can see on tonight's show.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Miliband was interesting because he was trying to lay out what he called the &ldquo;Second Wave of New Labour Foreign Policy&rdquo;. I'll be asking tonight whether this amounts to anything more than forgetting the First Wave.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Now, back to the fug. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Brown "I will not let you down," says Gordon Brown as he promises to build a "Britain of aspiration" in his first speech to the Labour conference as Prime Minister. But can he really "unlock the talents" of the British people and provide public services "personal to all"?  Jeremy is at Labour's conference in Bournemouth and will be interviewing Cabinet Minister Jack Straw. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Plus, what do the voters think of the new Prime Minister and his Tory rival David Cameron?

Burmese military threatens monks</unknownNode><unknownNode>Burma It's been a huge show of dissent against a government not known for it's tolerance of dissent. Up to a hundred thousand protesters have marched through the streets of Rangoon - the sixth day of marches, sparked by economic worries over the government's rise in fuel prices.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>The demonstrations in Burma have grown in size and confidence by the day. In fact few can understand why the ruling junta hasn't cracked down on them before now. Today, the first shot across the bows as the country's religious leader warned the many marching monks not to take their protests further, invoking images of the violence that occurred during the last crackdown. So will the protestors take heed? Or has the peace movement gathered enough momentum to carry on regardless?     Anger at Iran leader's NY speech</unknownNode><unknownNode>Richard Dannatt Do we actually appreciate the work our soldiers are doing in Iraq? Never one to fear the outspoken word, the head of the army, General Sir Richard Dannatt has voiced his concern about the growing gulf between serving soldiers and the rest of the population. His worry is that men and women returning from war find the public increasingly dismissive or indifferent. Or just don&rsquo;t understand the cause for which they've been offering their lives. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Newsnight has looked extensively at the covenant between soldier and public in recent weeks (watch here). But this is the first time a top military leader has explicitly shown his fear of this dislocation. And implicitly, perhaps, criticism of the mission itself? Army chief's concern over public Watch more Newsnight Iraq reports</unknownNode><unknownNode>Back in Business If Gordon Brown ne Prudence was worried the past week of Northern Rockiness would have cost him his reputation as the Iron Chancellor, his mind may be put at rest after the results of this poll. Newsnight has found Labour comfortably ahead of the other parties when voters are asked whom they would trust to best run the economy. The ICM poll indicated a high level of confidence among the public about the economic climate, and surprisingly perhaps, even their own financial prospects. So armed with this knowledge and a possible spring in his step, is Gordon more likely to announce a snap election next week?

A few of you came up with droll suggestions - I liked "Mervyn. Chasing his tail", "Warkies" and "Did you threaten to overrule him? maybe Diddy for short" - but I'm sorry to say the early leader didn't show a great deal of imagination on your part. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Last night it seemed certain the winner would be "Paxo", and frankly I thought we might have to overrule you. But then, like the Today programme before us, we fell victim to what was clearly a write-in campaign aimed at distorting the outcome of the vote. </unknownNode><unknownNode>From nowhere the name "Awooga" appeared and quickly gathered steam. By our deadline of 3pm today "Paxo" or variations thereof had 54 votes and "Awooga" had stormed up on the rails to...exactly the same number - 54. What to do? </unknownNode><unknownNode>In the current climate of budgetary restraint we thought it wouldn't be appropriate to have two imaginary dogs, so we've given ourselves the casting vote. On the grounds that "Awooga" was a pure-bred, if coordinated, suggestion whereas "Paxo" came in several mongrel variations, we hereby name the Newsnight dog "Awooga". </unknownNode><unknownNode>Having checked our urban slang dictionary we don't think it's a rude word, but perhaps you, the viewer, know better? </unknownNode><unknownNode>Tonight on Newsnight we have convened a focus group to look at how politicians from the leading parties perform on environmental issues.</unknownNode><unknownNode>US pollster, Frank Luntz asked a group of sceptics and believers how important policies on the environment were to them.

Publicly it stresses this will be achieved &ldquo;without resorting to violence&rdquo; and &ldquo;following an exclusively political method.&rdquo;</unknownNode><unknownNode>But this image was shattered in our interview when Maajid Nawaz confirmed that the organisation secretly believes that killing millions of innocent people to expand the Caliphate would be justified.</unknownNode><unknownNode>&ldquo;They are prepared to, once they&rsquo;ve established the State, to fight other countries and to kill people in the pursuit of unifying this state into one state.

My favourite answer from one lovely "mature" lady simply: "I'm eighty one love!"</unknownNode><unknownNode>Anyway, my complete undoing was an attempt at the end of the piece, to helpfully give out a list of conversion formulae, including how to change distances given in miles to distances in kilometres. </unknownNode><unknownNode>To convert miles to kilometres, I helpfully explained, "multiply your miles by 1.069".</unknownNode><unknownNode>It was, rather UNhelpfully, wrong. The real formula is 1 mile = 1.609 km.</unknownNode><unknownNode>So, I'm sorry. Genuinely, It's always poor to get things wrong. And particularly things that can be easily checked. </unknownNode><unknownNode>If only I could say: "I'm 43 love" and leave it at that. But that doesn't quite work does it - much like some of my conversion formulae.</unknownNode><unknownNode>HIZB-UT-TAHRIR Maajid Nawaz, one of the most senior members of the radical Islamist party Hizb-ut-Tahrir talks exclusively to Newsnight tonight.  Nawaz reveals how Hizb-ut-Tahrir advocate the killing of millions of people to unite and expand an Islamic super-state and why he resigned from the party. </unknownNode><unknownNode>For 12 years Maajid Nawaz was inside Hizb-ut-Tahrir, not only propagating their views in Britain, but exporting them to Pakistan and Denmark. He was imprisoned in Egypt for four years for being a member of the party. Up until May this year he was on their leadership committee.   We hope to be getting Hizb-ut-Tahrir to respond to his allegations on the programme tonight.</unknownNode><unknownNode>PETRAEUS US presidential contenders Hilary Clinton and Barack Obama are among the senators cross examining America&rsquo;s top commander in Iraq, General Petraeus, about the surge strategy today. Will we get a fresh insight into the possible US troop exit strategy post-Bush?  Mark Urban will be in Washington as this story unfolds. And we're expecting an interview with a leading Republican senator.</unknownNode><unknownNode>BIN LADEN Al-Qaeda has released a new video praising the September 11th attacks. The tape features a still image of Osama Bin Laden - who can be heard praising one of the 19 men who hijacked planes and flew them into targets across the eastern United States. But is this the real Bin Laden? Richard Watson analyses the latest statement.</unknownNode><unknownNode>MADELEINE McCANN  We'll have the latest on the Madeleine McCann case. </unknownNode><unknownNode>WEIGHTS AND MEASURES  And a European threat to pints and miles will finally be lifted today.  Jackie Long has been quizzing people on the streets and finds them confused about our use of both imperial and metric measures.</unknownNode><unknownNode> </unknownNode><unknownNode>Is the surge working? The top US commander in Iraq General David Petraeus and Ambassador to Baghdad Ryan Crocker are beginning to answer that question today, at a committee hearing of US politicians. Seventy percent of Iraqis seem to think security has got worse in the area covered by the surge, according to a poll commissioned by the BBC. But the Ambassador and the General are reported to have come to a different conclusion. The US Democrats hoped that the Petraeus Crocker report might help them. But will it - in fact - provide President Bush with some much needed political cover to "stay the course?" Mark Urban's in Washington and we'll be talking to a Democratic and Republican congressman.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Refugee crisis One effect of the Iraq war that is seldom reported is the influx of refugees into neighbouring countries. Syria, according to the UNHCR, sees 2,000 Iraqis cross the border every day. It's thought 1.5m in all have fled there since the invasion. But Newsnight understands that the Syrian government has had enough, and is on the verge of shutting the border, and setting up refugee camps. Our Baghdad correspondent Andrew North has been to Syria to see how the country has coped</unknownNode><unknownNode>Union discontent It was his first address to the TUC as Labour leader, and Gordon Brown got a rather lukewarm reception. He stressed that a tight public sector pay settlement is necessary to cool the economy. Meawhile another union - the PCS - is to be balloted on possible strike action. Does a ratcheting up of the rhetoric actually suit both sides? David Grossman is there.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Sharif sent home  Nawaz Sharif, who returned to his native country early this morning in a bid to take on General Musharraf in forthcoming elections, spent a matter of minutes on Pakistani soil today before being arrested on money-laundering charges and dispatched to Saudi Arabia. Could this decisive move backfire on the General? We'll be speaking to the Pakistani Information Minister.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Mr Sharif spoke to Newsnight a short time ago about his decision to return to Pakistan - watch it here.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Judging by the numerous comments on my piece last week on extremist material in public libraries, there's nothing like a debate about political Islam to stir the emotions. </unknownNode><unknownNode>I really like getting feedback from you, even if some comments are pretty disparaging - usually from those who believe we obsess about these matters. But I make no apology for that. The terror threat - more specifically the Islamist terror threat - is the defining story of our age. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Oscar Wilde had it about right when he said not being talked about is the worst fate a writer can face. Newsnight likes to be at the centre of the debate so please continue to tell us your views and suggest stories for us to cover. </unknownNode><unknownNode>So with all this in mind, we've created a special web page which pulls together a lot of our work on terrorism, radicalism and related subjects. We hope you find it a useful resource.  Richard</unknownNode><unknownNode>Search for Madeleine A McCann family spokeswoman has said that the Portuguese police suspect the mother of missing four-year-old Madeleine McCann is involved in her death. Justine McGuinness said officers suggested that traces of Madeleine's blood were in the McCanns' car, which was hired 25 days after she vanished. Kate McCann was formally named as a suspect in the case earlier today, while her husband Gerry has arrived at a police station for further questioning a few minutes ago. </unknownNode><unknownNode>We'll have the latest in the extraordinary twists and turns in the investigation. And we hope to be speaking to a McCann family member and a Portuguese journalist about the case.</unknownNode><unknownNode> Foot and Mouth A report into the the recent foot-and-mouth disease outbreak in Surrey has found it was probably caused by leaking drains, heavy rain and vehicle movement at a laboratory in Pirbright. The Environment Secretary Hillary Benn said there was no excuse for the outbreak. We'll be interviewing him on the programme tonight. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Newsnight Review And on Newsnight Review, Tom Paulin, John Harris and Julie Myerson join Kirsty to discuss Joe Wright's big screen adaptation of Ian McEwan's novel Atonement, starring Keira Knightley and James McAvoy.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Plus, Michael Ondaatje's new novel Divisadero, PJ Harvey's new album White Chalk and the Klaxons perform on the programme, fresh from stunning the music industry by winning the Mercury Award for their album Myths of the Near Future.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Read more about what's on Newnight Review and leave your comments below.</unknownNode><unknownNode>I've just returned from interviewing General Sir Mike Jackson for what promises to be a fascinating special programme tonight on the state of the army. (Read an extract from his autobiography here.)</unknownNode><unknownNode>Broken Army?</unknownNode><unknownNode>The man who took over from Sir Mike as Chief of Defence Staff last year, General Sir Richard Dannatt, suggested the army was reaching breaking point. We're devoting all of tonight's programme to find out whether he's right - and to find out why, as our exclusive poll reveals, more than two thirds of us would be unhappy for our son or daughter to join the army.</unknownNode><unknownNode>The Defence Minister Lord Drayson will join me in the studio, alongside retired soldiers, and the mother of Ben Parkinson, who was severely injured in Afghanistan. And we'll be hearing a selection of viewers thoughts and questions posted on the Newsnight website.</unknownNode><unknownNode>We would like to thank the Imperial War Museum North for their assistance in the production of elements of the programme.</unknownNode><unknownNode> General Sir Mike Jackson's autobiography Soldier details key events during his 45 years of service in the British Army. From early cadet days, through service in Northern Ireland at the height of the Troubles, to commanding troops in Kosovo and overseeing deployments in Afghanistan and Iraq, the book examines the changing face of British soldiering and warfare.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Since standing down as Chief of Staff in 2006, he has been outspoken on many issues surrounding the military, most recently criticising US post-Iraq invasion plans.</unknownNode><unknownNode>The following extract is from the opening chapter of the book, Schoolboy.  From Chapter 1 - Schoolboy</unknownNode><unknownNode>I am a soldier. I have held every rank in the British Army from officer cadet to four-star general. I am now retired, but my almost forty-five years of service ensure that I remain a soldier at heart. My father was a soldier, my elder son has been a soldier and my younger son is thinking about becoming a soldier. My father-in-law, my brothers-in-law and my son-in-law have all been soldiers &ndash; so the Army is something of a family tradition. But my father didn&rsquo;t push me in that direction, and what I have said to my sons is that it is your life, and therefore your call, and you must decide what you want to do with it. I am pleased that both of them have decided to follow the path I took, but I would have been entirely content had they chosen otherwise.</unknownNode><unknownNode> 						Continue reading "Soldier - General Sir Mike Jackson" 					</unknownNode><unknownNode>Extremist library books Are public libraries inadvertently helping political Islamists in their recruitment drive? We reveal how extremist Islamic literature - including works by men convicted of incitement to murder - are freely available in public libraries in Tower Hamlets and how the collection is, in the words of the man who carried out the research "warped" towards extreme Islam. One former Islamist tells us these kinds of books are "dangerous".  So are these libraries failing their local community?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Terror arrests Possibly more devastating than Madrid or London - That is the verdict of the German officials on arresting three terror suspects earlier today who are accused of plotting to blow up Frankfurt Airport and and American military base in the country. Those arrested appear to have spent time at a Pakistani terror training camp. We'll have the latest details.</unknownNode><unknownNode>A leaky pipe A report into the Foot and Mouth outbreak earlier in the summer is expected to find that the virus was carried through faulty pipes which leaked during the floods. But who is to blame? </unknownNode><unknownNode>What hope for Darfur? We travel to the region with the UN Secretary General as he visits a refugee camp in Darfur and assesses the humanitarian crisis.  He's also meeting the Sudanese President to discuss the deployment of the UN/AU peacekeeping force. But how effective can the force be when the Sudanese government are calling the shots. Meanwhile factional fighting between several different rebel groups is making the situation even more difficult to resolve.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Wiki-future We talk to the author of a new book called 'Wikinomics' who says we've barely begun to see how the internet will effect the way we live and work. Social networking is passe and will be replaced by collaboration in which individuals will be given the opportunity to become the professionals - leading to greater innovation and changing the way business and scientific problems can be solved. Is this a cheap way for businesses to carry out research or are we entering a new era in which the power of the consumer is on a more equal footing with big business? Read an extract and leave your thoughts here.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Army Special And a quick reminder about our special programme on Thursday about the state of the army. We'll have the first interview with General Sir Mike Jackson in advance of the launch of his autobiography next week. And you can submit your own thoughts in writing on the website, or create a video message and send us a link by clicking here. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Wikinomics by Don Tapscott and Anthony D. Williams looks at how companies are beginning to use mass collaboration of knowledge to gain success.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Citing many examples of successful and surprising projects, the authors explain how big businesses could harness external expertise by engaging directly with and rewarding participation from their customers, users and a wide pool of informed contributors - a method of epitomised by the online encyclopaedia 'Wikipedia', where entries are written and edited by users. 'Crowdsourcing' rather than 'outsourcing' as they put it.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Far from being sceptical about the power of mass collaboration - see Andrew Keen's The Cult of the Amateur, another Newsnight Book Club entry - Tapscott and Williams claim Wikinomics could provide the basis for huge economic and intellectual growth.</unknownNode><unknownNode>In line with their own thesis, the last chapter of the book will be written by readers and is already open for contributions here.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Watch Paul Mason's report on Wikinomics and an interview with Don Tapscott.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Read the book's introduction below, and leave your thoughts and comments at the end.</unknownNode><unknownNode>From the introduction Throughout history corporations have organized themselves according to strict hierarchical lines of authority. Everyone was a subordinate to someone else&mdash;employees versus managers, marketers versus customers, producers versus supply chain subcontractors, companies versus the community. There was always someone or some company in charge, controlling things, at the &ldquo;top&rdquo; of the food chain. While hierarchies are not vanishing, profound changes in the nature of technology, demographics, and the global economy are giving rise to powerful new models of production based on community, collaboration, and self-organization rather than on hierarchy and control.</unknownNode><unknownNode> 						Continue reading "Wikinomics - Don Tapscott and Anthony D. Williams" 					</unknownNode><unknownNode> BROWN NOT-SO-NEW POLITICS? Prime Minister Gordon Brown has said he wants to encourage greater engagement in a new style of politics. Yet today he brushed off calls to go up against Conservative leader, David Cameron in a TV debate  insisting there were "plenty of opportunities" for him to be questioned already. Questioned by our Poliitcal Correspondent David Grossman at the monthly press conference Mr Brown stressed he appeared weekly in the House of Commons at Prime Minister's Question Time and that he made regular statements to MPs.  The Tories have accused Gordon Brown of "running away" from the debate.</unknownNode><unknownNode>We hope to be asking a senior member of the Cabinet why as a believer in a new style of politics Gordon Brown won't have a TV leaders debate. </unknownNode><unknownNode>TERROR He describes himself as a Muslim fundamentalist. And yet he agreed to spy on a group of young radical muslims accused of planning terrorist attacks. Eighteen young men were arrested in Canada last year and are due to stand trial in what will be the country's most high profile terrorist case. But it's the role of the informer which has caused most controversy - not least within the Muslim community with some accusing him of being a rat. That informer - Mubin Shaikh - has spoken to the BBC's Security Correspondent Gordon Corera about why he became an informer. </unknownNode><unknownNode>IRAQ Leaders of Iraq's Sunni and Shia factions are to consider a series of principles on non-violence after talks involving Northern Ireland and South African politicians. The discussion were held at a secret location in Finland over the weekend. We will be bringing together a Sunni and Shia with Northern Ireland politician Jeffrey Donaldson who's been at the talks. We'll discuss whether Iraqis can learn from the lessons of previous conflicts. </unknownNode><unknownNode>JANE TOMLINSON The terminally-ill fundraiser Jane Tomlinson has died. The mum of three from Leeds lost her seven year battle with cancer. She'd raised one-and-three-quarter million pounds by completing marathons and other endurance events after being diagnosed with the disease. We'll be discussing  what led her to great acts of altruism while she was so ill. </unknownNode><unknownNode/><unknownNode>     </unknownNode><unknownNode>David Cameron's been warned not to abandon the Thatcher legacy by a former deputy Conservative leader.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Michael Ancram is calling for a return to what he calls &ldquo;core Tory values&rdquo; on tax and the family.</unknownNode><unknownNode>This broadside against the leadership can be seen as bad timing for the Conservatives &ndash; it comes on the day of another policy review and takes the shine off a positive opinion poll that suggests the party is just a percentage point behind Labour.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Are the policy reviews sending out conflicting messages? Are the Conservatives in danger of presenting confusing signals to the public?</unknownNode><unknownNode>BASRA As British troops complete their pull out from Basra palace, Newsnight has some stark poll findings about voters' attitude to the army's mission in Iraq. We'll bring you full details on the programme, but the most arresting headline is that over half of those polled think victory is no longer possible.</unknownNode><unknownNode>We hope to put the detailed findings to a Defence Minister. And Mark Urban will be analysing the significance of the move to Basra airport.</unknownNode><unknownNode>THE NEW POLITICS Gordon Brown told us today he's going to reconvene a rare procedure known as the Speaker's Conference to find out why voter turnout is so low. Could it be because there's not enough difference between what the two main parties are offering? There seems to be even less difference today, with Gordon Brown strengthening his concept of a government of "national unity" by offering two Tory MPs and a Liberal Democrat advisory roles to help formulate government policy. Is he genuinely reaching out, or trying to neutralise his opponents?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Meanwhile the Tories have made a significant step into Labour territory, by promising to stick to the government's spending plans if elected. So - if you believe in tax cuts - who on earth do you vote for now?</unknownNode><unknownNode>We'll hear from the three main parties.  PEDRO ALMODOVAR The doyen of Spanish cinema is over in Britain to see one of his most celebrated films - All About My Mother - adapted into a stage play at Kevin Spacey's Old Vic. Madeleine Holt went to meet him, and discovered that in his next cinematic project he feels ready to confront an episode of Spanish history he's spent his lifetime trying to deny... </unknownNode><unknownNode>On Thursday Newsnight will be devoting the whole programme to an analysis of the state of the Army.  We'll have the first broadcast interview with General Sir Mike Jackson in advance of the release of his controversial autobiography, Soldier. Mark Urban will explore whether the funding and operation commitments of the Army have led to a crisis, and whether radical changes to its functions and set-up are needed. And we'll be releasing some fascinating polling about the public's attitude to the army, and its work in Iraq and Afghanistan.</unknownNode><unknownNode>And we'll be joined by a Defence Minister, who will be answering questions from a panel which will include former serving soldiers. But we'd also like to hear from you. What is the burning issue you want the MoD to address, or the one big question you want answered?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Leave your comments and thoughts below or send your message as a video - you can upload it to a video sharing website, and send us the link. (Please read these guidelines before submitting.) We'll aim to show some of them on Thursday's programme.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Food production</unknownNode><unknownNode>Hello viewers - I hope you've eaten well tonight - some fish perhaps, lasagne, vegetables and rice? Imagine the prospect of producing more food in the next 50 years, than during the past 10,000 years. Apocalyptic? Yes, but not a fantasy. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Scientists meeting in Iceland this weekend are warning that to keep up with the growth in population we might need this much foodstuff. But where is the fertile land to grow crops and rear animals? And are we going to achieve the food levels and quality we need by massive agribusinesses, or by local production? </unknownNode><unknownNode>This is all up for discussion at the UN-sponsored forum in Iceland and we will create some of the debate here on Newsnight tonight. Do tell us what you think.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Referendum Are Gordon Brown's defences against a EU reform referendum being chipped away from within as well as without? Following last week's decision by the RMT and the GMB to push for a motion on a referendum at the TUC conference, Keith Vaz, the former Europe Minister delivered his own call for a referendum today and it seems the foreign Secretary David Miliband has refused to rule out a referendum. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Michael Crick our political editor reports on the chances of a poll, and whether the pressure to hold one may have an impact on the timing of the general election.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Kung Fu And then we have a colourful film from the Shaolin temple in China, home to hundreds of warrior monks who practise kung fu every day. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Following the resurgence of the Shaolin Bhuddist monks after the repression of the Cultural Revolution Shaolin is now big business with a million tourists a year, a kung fu reality show, and thousands of young Chinese coming to learn kung fu every year.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Pakistan London has been the scene this week for serious power-brokering over the future direction of Pakistan. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Today at the Dorchester Hotel, former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif confirmed that he will return to Pakistan to challenge President Musharraf. President Musharraf, who ousted Nawaz Sharif as Prime Minister eight years ago in a bloodless coup has threatened to arrest Sharif if he enters Pakistan. Meanwhile Benazir Bhutto has said she's close to securing a deal with President Musharraf in which he will agree to step down from the army and stand as a civilian candidate in the election. </unknownNode><unknownNode>So is Nawaz Sharif really the best hope Pakistan has for a return to democracy and an end to the political unrest which has been shaking the country in the last few months? We have an interview with Mr Sharif.</unknownNode><unknownNode>A &amp; E  We have often heard complaints from hospital staff about how the plethora of targets distort clinical priorities. What we hear more rarely is concrete examples of what this means for patients.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>Now a junior doctor has written a book about life working in a busy Accident and Emergency ward. Writing under a pseudonym to protect his anonymity, Dr Nick Edwards argues that although additional resources and targets on waiting times have led to improvements for some, the pressure to achieve those targets can mean medical staff fiddle the figures to ensure patients get the treatment they need. We'll be putting his criticisms to the government's Emergency Health Tzar.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>Faking it A hot topic at the moment is how broadcasters can restore trust in television. Something we've all been discussing here is when does artifice become deception? Now, in an attempt to re-build viewers' trust, Channel Five News has decided to ban "noddies" and "staged questions". </unknownNode><unknownNode>Tonight we'll attempt to show how TV news pieces are put together using these techniques and ask whether this is a bold move towards transparency or an unnecessary over-reaction.  Let us know what you think here.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Diana and the Express It's difficult not to be aware that tomorrow is the tenth anniversary of Princess Diana's death. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Over those ten years one newspaper in particular has assiduously followed every twist and turn in the story of what happened in that tunnel in Paris - the Daily Express.  Why is this? Is it just a cheap lead for the Express or has the paper been giving its readers what they want?</unknownNode><unknownNode>A hot topic at the moment is how broadcasters can restore trust in television. Something we've all been discussing here is when does artifice become deception? </unknownNode><unknownNode>Now, in an attempt to re-build viewers' trust, Channel Five News has decided to ban "noddies" and "staged questions". </unknownNode><unknownNode>Tonight on Newsnight we'll attempt to show how TV news pieces are put together using these techniques and ask whether this is a bold move towards transparency or an unnecessary over-reaction. Are "noddies" (shots of the interviewer placed over an edit point), "staged questions" (recorded after the interviewee has left because there is only one camera) and walking set-up shots to introduce an interviewee an acceptable part of the way television programmes are made, or do they distort the truth? </unknownNode><unknownNode>Let us know what you think.</unknownNode><unknownNode>We've a special edition of Newsnight tonight in which we talk to the man who - if there really is going to be a General Election this autumn - could be British Prime Minister in a matter of weeks. David Cameron has had a bad summer. Gordon Brown - now ahead in the opinion polls - says the wheels have come off the Cameron bicycle. </unknownNode><unknownNode>I'll be joined by the Newsnight political, economic and diplomatic editors - and we'll be asking Mr Cameron questions based on the many received on this website. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Will he really raise taxes on aircraft passengers? What does he make of the widening gap between rich and poor? He says he wants to reward marriage - does that mean people who have children out of wedlock should think about tying the knot?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Click here to watch the programme now - and leave your comments below.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Iraq We'll lead tonight with Iraq and the calls from both sides of the Atlantic for the Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki to resign. The French foreign minister Bernard Kouchner apologised for asking Mr Maliki to go. American politicians think Mr Maliki has failed to unite his country. But how far is this blaming the Iraqis for a catastrophe imposed on the country by ... well ... us?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Cheney Dick Cheney is - famously - the most powerful Vice President in US history. But is he now one of the most isolated? With the resignation of Alberto Gonzales as Attorney General and following Donald Rumsfeld's departure from the Pentagon plus the strategist Karl Rove leaving the White House, how important is Mr Cheney these days?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Prostitutes A year after a serial killer murdered  five prostitutes in Ipswich Newsnight has gone back to the city's red light district to see whether a new strategy by the police to  crack down on kerb crawlers and offer more support to sex workers is proving a success. If it works, there's a possibility other police forces might use similar methods.</unknownNode><unknownNode>All that plus Denis Healey at 90. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Cameron Also, a quick word about tomorrow's special Newsnight programme - an interview with the Conservative party leader David Cameron. He wants to be Prime Minister - but does he have the right stuff to lead our country, after a dismal summer of internal party rows and poor opinion poll ratings? Let us know what you would like us to ask Mr Cameron by contributing to the debate on the Newsnight website. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Never mind the scandals: what&rsquo;s it all for?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Oh dear. What a terrible trade we work in. Blue Peter is bent. Five is a faker. Richard and Judy&rsquo;s  competitions give a glorious new meaning to their slogan &lsquo;You say, we pay.&rsquo; (They did, to the tune of hundreds of thousands of pounds.)  Big Brother gets castigated for being an exploitative freak show. (Sorry, what&rsquo;s the story there, then?) The ITV press office misrepresents a documentary. Channel Four&rsquo;s Born Survivor Bear Grylls turns out to need Room Service. Even Children in Need, and Comic Relief, turn out to be guilty of something  worse than insufferable smugness. The Prime Minister is mad at us. Even the Queen is cross.  And that great Alpha Male, Gordon Ramsay can&rsquo;t even catch his own fucking fish.</unknownNode><unknownNode> 						Continue reading "The James MacTaggart Memorial Lecture" 					</unknownNode><unknownNode>The main event in television today is happening in Edinburgh, where the annual TV festival gets underway. The big topic up for discussion there is standards and what's become of them.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Back in London we'll be doing our bit to reverse this supposed decline.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Our main topic is, once again, the fatal shooting of 11 year old Rhys Jones. Merseyside police have issued a direct appeal for the killer, thought to be a child himself, to give himself up. They also need more information from eyewitnesses.</unknownNode><unknownNode>It is a particular feature of this type of crime that police encounter a wall of silence from the communities that hold the answers. That was the case when 15 year old Billy Cox became the 3rd school child to be shot dead in South London early this year.  Today we return to the estate in North Clapham where he died to see what if anything has changed.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Then to Afghanistan where British soldiers are facing daily dangers. It makes news that three more have died, all presumed victims of so-called friendly fire, all the more tragic. It's reported the three, all from the 1st Battalion the Royal Anglian Regiment, were killed by an American bomb.  Two of their colleagues were injured. We&rsquo;ll hear the latest.</unknownNode><unknownNode>It makes another battle that's going on, up in Edinburgh, sound quite trivial by comparison, but Jeremy Paxman's lecture to the annual television festival tonight is bound to generate big headlines. Following weeks of debate about trust and standards, he's calling for the rescue of what he says is the "very soul of the medium." </unknownNode><unknownNode>We'll also report from another festival, this one, surprisingly, in North Iraq.  It's the first arts festival in that country in recent years and we'll be showing you the highlights.</unknownNode><unknownNode>David Cameron has had a rough few months since Gordon Brown took over as Prime Minister. First there was the Grammar school row: then "David Cameron's Conservatives" failed to make much progress in the Ealing Southall by-election; a stumble on his attack over the Government's running of the NHS; a trip to Rwanda while his constituency was flooded. BUT perhaps most worrying for David Cameron is that, for the first time since becoming leader of his party, he's behind in the polls.</unknownNode><unknownNode>On Wednesday, in a Newsnight special, David Cameron will be quizzed by our Editors about his leadership and what he proposes for Britain. We want to know what you would like us to ask. Let us know here and we'll hope to include some of your questions in the programme. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Anarchy in the UK?</unknownNode><unknownNode>From tonight's presenter, Emily Maitlis:</unknownNode><unknownNode>Why has the killing of 11 year-old Rhys Jones shocked the entire country? It sounds like a stupid question, but it merits a moment's thought. Is it because he was shot? Is it because he was so young? Or is it because we think it's now symptomatic of the direction in which this country's going? Early this week David Cameron referred to Anarchy in the UK. He hardly coined the phrase. The song title - by the Sex Pistols - was released over 30 years ago. So have things actually got worse, or does every generation think it's on the verge of anarchy?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Two days ago, the story of a sausage hit the headlines. Indeed, the sausage in question hit an elderly man walking past the window of a young-ish boy. The case was brought before the crown prosecution service which was itself confused. Should they try the boy for antisocial behaviour or spend their time and our money elsewhere? Even the media were puzzled. Do we call it Just William? Or Just Stupid? One news bulletin asked. </unknownNode><unknownNode>But perhaps the question is more central than we realise. Does the kind of crime that ends in the shooting of an 11 year-old boy start with the lobbing of a sausage? And if we crack down on one sausage thrower early with parental or court discipline, do we cut down on life-ruining antisocial crime later? They called this zero tolerance in New York and it seemed to work there under Rudy Giuliani. But would it work here? Just one of the questions we'll be considering tonight as we dedicate the entire programme to the issues surrounding the death of Rhys Jones in Liverpool.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>Our panel of five - including experts in the field of gun crime, youth work, violent gangs - as well as the Home Secretary herself - will be helping us to analyse why this problem now seems so endemic to Britain, and whether we actually have the root causes right. Today Gordon Brown promised new laws and tougher enforcement. But this country has not been short on initiatives - be they ASBOs or Parenting Orders - which in many cases simply fail to do the job. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Indeed the government itself showed how little sway it had earlier this week: unable to deport a convicted criminal - the killer of headmaster Philip Lawrence - because the European legislation proved too robust to allow it to have its way. So are the institutions which are there to protect - courts, immigration services, police - left impotent by dogged legislation?       </unknownNode><unknownNode>This evening, the big questions are tackled head on: What causes violent crime? And how do we stop it.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Join us tonight, and let us know your thoughts below.</unknownNode><unknownNode>From tonight's presenter Kirsty Wark:</unknownNode><unknownNode>EUROPE  The EU Constitution is back on the agenda today with the news that three trades unions are throwing their weight behind the campaign for a referendum on the draft treaty. The GMB and RMT are considering using the TUC conference as a platform to press for the vote which was promised on the Constitution in the Labour Party's 2005 election manifesto. The government insists that there is no need for a referendum on the basis that the latest watered down proposals don't amount to a constitution, and don't cede sovereign powers to Europe. But can the Labour Government withstand the political pressure to hold a vote? Sadly Gordon Brown and Angela Merkel are otherwise engaged at a football match but we'll have some pretty high powered substitutes - politicians, thinkers and trades unionists.</unknownNode><unknownNode>LARISA ARAP Is Russia using Soviet era methods of repression to deal with critics of Vladimir Putin? Larisa Arap - a member of Gary Kasparov's opposition United Civil Front - has been released after being forcibly hospitalised in a psychiatric clinic near her home city of Murmansk. Her case was taken up by human rights campaigners and activists who claim her detention was revenge for exposing the alleged abuse of children at that same psychiatric hospital. Newsnight has secured an interview today with Larisa and we'll also be joined by former political prisoner Vladimir Bukovsky who tells us he knows of other similar cases.</unknownNode><unknownNode>IRAQ Others have likened America's involvement in Iraq to its role in Vietnam in the 1970s. Now George Bush himself has made the link. In an interesting speech in Kansas, he uses the example of Vietnam as an argument against early withdrawal of troops from Iraq saying in both cases a US withdrawal is harmful to American credibility with its critics. We'll have reaction to the speech from Washington.</unknownNode><unknownNode>IQ And are children getting smarter? Stephanie Flanders has being trying to find out why children seem to perform better in IQ type tests than they used to. Are these children superbrains or were their grandparents just thick? Is it to do with better nutrition, smaller families, or do video and computer games mean that children are better at solving abstract problems?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Politicians and the NHS</unknownNode><unknownNode>Politicians love to do battle over the NHS so is David Cameron right about hospital closures or is he wrong? Are a whole load about to close or not? The Conservatives have their list of the 29 at risk and David Cameron has been touring the country to offer them support BUT today a member of his shadow team apologised to his local hospital saying that it was wrong that it was on the list. Since then many Trusts and hospitals on the list have also denied they are under threat. The truth? We'll be trying to find out and testing both Labour and the Conservatives' claims.</unknownNode><unknownNode>NEETs</unknownNode><unknownNode>Here's a statistic the government wont like. 1.2 million 16-24 year olds are NEETs. In other words more than a million young people in the UK are " Not in Employment, Education or Training. " Jackie Long has been to Walsall to meet and hear from a number of people in this position.

As a result the Catholic church has asked followers to resign from Amnesty. The Bishop of East Anglia has done so after being a member for 31 years. He joins us on the programme to debate with Amnesty his decision.</unknownNode><unknownNode>A GameShow Education</unknownNode><unknownNode>It's India's newest reality TV show and over the weekend Arvind Aradhya won.

Meanwhile British forces in Basra are vulnerable to increasing rocket attacks from insurgent s in the desert on their encampment, apparently as many as ten a week. Tonight we'll be assessing whether the British military has "lost" Basra, and, if we have, are we staying there because of transatlantic pressure? </unknownNode><unknownNode>The tents and the banners are coming down and the campfires are cold. Was the week long protest - fest at Heathrow over global warming and airport expansion a damp squib? Is there climate change fatigue - the leading article in the new edition of Ecologist magazine seems to suggest there is. But is that because companies and local authorities have responded to pressure and adopted climate friendlier policies? Is there a lack of leadership from politicians, who once told us that global warming was the biggest threat facing the planet? Or is it because the pollution threat from China and India is so grave, it seems futile for individuals to make tough lifestyle choices which have a miniscule impact.</unknownNode><unknownNode>The Reverend Jesse Jackson is in London to launch Equanomics, an organisation dedicated to the promotion of black leaders in business politics and industry. He was the founder of Operation Push in the states in the early eighties which became the Rainbow Push coalition, and I'll be asking him why he thinks Britain seems resistant to black power. </unknownNode><unknownNode>From Elton John to Roman Abramovitch - owning a football club is a prestigious and expensive business, and not for the faint-hearted, but the new proprietor of Manchester City is perhaps the most controversial yet. The former Prime Minister of Thailand, Thaksin Shinawatra is spending millions on the club, but back home in Thailand, the country he fled after being ousted in a military coup, he's being prosecuted for corruption, and human rights groups say his record on human rights alone should bar him from owning a football club. We have a profile of a man who is, at least,  popular in parts of Manchester. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Tonight&rsquo;s programme is presented by Jeremy Paxman.</unknownNode><unknownNode>TORIES The former Conservative cabinet minister, John Redwood, has outlined how Britain's tax laws should change if the Tories return to power. As well as abolishing inheritance tax and raising the threshold at which workers pay higher-rate income tax, Mr Redwood wants business costs to be cut by a fifth. Political Editor Michael Crick will be finding out if the Conservative leadership are prepared to go for these policies. So will tax become the new battleground at the next election?  We hope to be discussing this issue live with a senior Conservative and Labour politician.

The US military commander General David Petraeus is to deliver a progress report on the US "surge" next month and tonight we'll be asking whether the surge itself could have contributed to the violence in a hitherto "quieter" area, and why the Yazidi people may have been attacked now. Frantic hunt in Iraq bomb rubble  </unknownNode><unknownNode>The legacy of partition Sixty years ago today post colonial India was born, partitioned by the departing British Raj, and amidst today's celebrations are painful memories of the rioting and mass migration that followed. Throughout the tumultuous years that have followed, India has been a democratic secular state and has transformed from a country of extensive poverty to an economic powerhouse. But religious and cultural tensions remain, and not only for Indians in India, but also for Indians, Pakistanis, and Sikhs in the UK. We'll be debating the legacy of partition for second generation British Asians. India marks independence day</unknownNode><unknownNode>South Africa&rsquo;s legal storm The Truth and Reconciliation commission in South Africa left unfinished business, and the country is divided over a groundbreaking legal case.

We'll be reporting from South Africa on the case, which is causing a storm 13 years after the end of white minority rule.    </unknownNode><unknownNode>The Political Brain The book that many politicians will be secreting in their beach bags this summer is a fascinating new exploration of why people vote the way they do by the American professor of psychology and psychiatry, Drew Westen.</unknownNode><unknownNode>His theory - borne out by research into American elections - is that emotion is more important that reason for the voters - and that the politician who can "connect" on an emotional level is more likely to win than the politician who can reel off statistics, policies and promises.</unknownNode><unknownNode>So how does he rate Gordon Brown and David Cameron? I'll be asking both Drew Westen and Rick Nye, the director of the political analysts, Populus. The book is a great read! The Political Brain - read an excerpt</unknownNode><unknownNode>I owe an apology &ndash; of sorts &ndash; to Alastair Campbell.  When his diaries came out last month, nobody had much time to read them.  On the Monday of publication I managed about 200 pages (out of more than 750), and confined myself to reading about the early years of the Blair government. On Newsnight that night I expressed disappointment.  There was nothing very new in the book, I said, and many of the stories sounded quite familiar, I said.</unknownNode><unknownNode>I&rsquo;ve now read the remaining 550 pages, and done so rather more slowly and carefully than I did the first chunk.  I want to modify my verdict.  Although it&rsquo;s true that there are no great bombshells, the diaries are a valuable addition to the growing history of the Blair years.  They paint a fascinating, detailed picture of life at the heart of government &ndash; the tensions, bickering, and the relentless pressure.  I was particularly surprised by Blair&rsquo;s doubts at so many important moments, and his basic insecurity, so that he would be phoning Campbell every few minutes for reassurance.  I can&rsquo;t wait for the full versions to be published.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Campbell&rsquo;s friendships are interesting, too.  He was in regular contact with the former right-wing Conservative and fellow diarist Alan Clark, and also got on well with several other Tories - Nicholas Soames, David Davis and Michael Heseltine.  But as a Manchester United fan, and biographer of Alex Ferguson, I was especially interested in Campbell&rsquo;s close contacts with the United manager.  Ferguson fed Campbell and Blair lots of advice in the run-up to the 1997 election, telling them that Labour was so well ahead in the polls that they should play it safe - as if they were winning a match 2-0 with only a few minutes to go.  Let your opponents take all the risks, Ferguson advised, and open themselves up to giving away more goals.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Given the Labour spin doctor&rsquo;s close friendship with Ferguson, I&rsquo;ve always been curious as to why Campbell allowed both men to make essentially the same mistake.  Ferguson told the world he would retire as United manager in 2002, but that announcement causing him nothing but grief, and he eventually changed his mind of course with only a few months to go (and is still in power at Old Trafford).  Then in the autumn of 2004 Tony Blair famously announced a rough timetable for his departure as Prime Minister.  Over the next three years that announcement also caused Blair huge trouble.  Like Sir Alex, he deeply regretted it.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>The lesson to any man of power: time your departure to come as a complete surprise.   </unknownNode><unknownNode>From tonight's presenter, Kirsty Wark</unknownNode><unknownNode>North of the border</unknownNode><unknownNode>We begin tonight with the First Minister of Scotland Alex Salmond's plans for a referendum on independence.     In their election manifesto the nationalists promised a white paper on a referendum within 100 days of an SNP administration. But the opposition parties have ganged up on the minority administration to oppose any referendum, and without the support of a substantial grouping (and so a majority) it&rsquo;s hard to see how a referendum could become a reality.     Alex Salmond has called for a "national conversation" and the White Paper encompasses not only the independence option but what's been nicknamed the "devolution max" position under which the Scottish Parliament could have a range of new powers including, for example, fiscal powers, energy policy, or broadcasting.</unknownNode><unknownNode>At the same time the three opposition parties will now jointly review the devolution settlement opening the way to the accrual of further powers.     So it is a potentially dynamic situation which poses a number of questions for the Prime Minister Gordon Brown. Will there be constructive engagement? Tonight I'll be interviewing Alex Salmond.  Then, to discuss Scotland&rsquo;s next step, I&rsquo;ll be talking to Lord Forsyth, the Conservative former Secretary of State for Scotland, who urges the Conservatives to back the referendum in order to shoot Alex Salmond's fox for once and for all. I&rsquo;ll also be speaking to Lord Steel of the Liberal Democrats - he was the first Presiding Officer of the Parliament - and the Labour MSP and former Scottish Justice Minister Cathy Jamieson. SNP outlines independence plans</unknownNode><unknownNode>Pakistan&rsquo;s anniversary</unknownNode><unknownNode>Pakistan celebrates 60 years since partition.  We'll be hearing live from Islamabad and from author and former BBC correspondent Mark Tully &ndash; he has made a film for Newsnight to coincide with India's anniversary of independence tomorrow. He'll be looking at how the country has changed, whether it is as tolerant as it likes to think it is and whether the caste system is such a prominent feature of Indian society today as it was 60 years ago. He'll also be assessing how diverse a culture exists in this democracy, whether America's influence is too pervasive and if religious tolerance is actually on the wane. Pakistan marks 60th anniversary</unknownNode><unknownNode>Lord Biffen remembered</unknownNode><unknownNode>"A great parliamentarian and respected Leader of the House of Commons."  That was the Prime Minister's tribute to the former Conservative Minister John Biffen who died early today. Lord Biffen was in Mrs Thatcher's Cabinet first as Chief Secretary to the Treasury but famously fell out with her whereupon he was described as a "semi-detached" member of the Cabinet. Lord Heseltine said that description referred to his ability to see both sides of the argument and that he was a very cerebral politician with a fine mind. Thatcher leads tributes to Biffin</unknownNode><unknownNode>By Steve Smith</unknownNode><unknownNode>Many of you have been getting in touch to say how much Tony &ldquo;Mr Manchester&rdquo; Wilson will be missed.</unknownNode><unknownNode>We were fortunate enough to record the last substantial interview with the former Factory Records boss before his untimely death. The producers of Desert Island Discs were set to invite Wilson on the programme. The music mogul, telly motormouth and inspiration for the film 24 Hour Party People would have been a great guest, but regrettably it was not to be.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Tony Wilson told us that he would have included Idiot Wind by Bob Dylan in his selection, and Lazyitis by the Happy Mondays. He wanted Atmosphere by Joy Division played at his funeral, he said. But he didn't complete the list of favourite songs while we were with him.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Newsnight Editor Peter Barron wonders what other discs Tony Wilson would have picked to complete the eight that every castaway is allowed to take to the fabled island...</unknownNode><unknownNode> Rove to go President Bush is waving farewell to the man who, arguably more than any other propelled him into the White House not once but twice. The departure of Karl Rove, Bush's Chief political adviser to spend more time with his family leaves just Dick Cheney and Condoleezza Rice from the original praetorian guard. The end of the Administration is in sight and it could be that Karl Rove sees little more for a man of a hawklike disposition to do. Rove's fingerprints are on every big Bush decision, in domestic as well as foreign policy, and on much more we didn't witness. His role behind the scenes in political manoeuvres  has been described as The Mark of Rove and as an article in the New Yorker once put it, Democrats use  "Rove"  as shorthand for the Bush administration,as in " Is Rove going to invade Syria?" such was his power.  Standing on The White House lawn today with Presdient Bush he said he would remain a fierce and committted advocate on the outside.  Tonight we'll offer up  two very different views of Karl Rove .  We'll be talking to a leading Republican politician and Democratic strategist, Sidney Blumenthal.      Heathrow Which is the greatest threat, terror or climate change? BAA is accusing the protestors mounting a week of action at Heathrow over the airports expanision plans,  of being irresponsible and unlawful. Mark Bullock , the managing director of BAA said, " With the current terrorism threat, keeping Heathrow safe and secure is a very serious business."   But at the Camp for Climate Action where the protestors are expecting 1500 people to congregate over the week, a spokeswoman Sophie Stevens said the police were " flexing their muscles." The Met say all officers are being briefed to use their powers "robustly." Tonight we'll be debating protest in a free society, and whether the recent terror attacks - including the one at glasgow airport change the rules.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>Conservatives "A tax cut by any other name," is how John Redwood head of one of David Cameron's policy review groups described Conservative plans to cut &pound;14 billion in red tape and regulation for UK businesses per year.  But will easing regulation such as data protection laws, scrapping Home Information Packs, relaxing rules on hours and health and safety regimes be better or worse for business, and would it put a Conservative government on a collision course wih Europe and open up a damaging split again.  Speaking to the Financial Times, the Shadow Chancellor George Osborne said a Conservative government would " pick a fight" with Brussels to achieve cuts in red tape. John Redwood,  one of  the most senior politicians on the right of David Cameron's Conservative party will be live in the studio.   Sewers Tomorrow promises to be a wild wet and windy day with the threat of more floods in England and Wales, and flash floods to boot. Can our sewers and drainage systems cope? Luckily for Newsnight our Culture correspondent Steve Smith knows all about underground Britain - not the counterculture but diabolical drains, and he's even written a book on the subject. He has been investigating the best and worst of our subterranean structures. He'll be sharing it with us tonight.    </unknownNode><unknownNode>Gordon Brown's refusal to rule out a snap election means the guessing game will continue - until his conference speech at least. And while the poll dance goes on, so all the parties must pretend they're ready and up for the campaign fight whenever it starts.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Newsnight is offering to help the Prime Minister make up his mind. We'll be taking our giant calendar (see right) to the Labour Party conference in Bournemouth and inviting MPs, activists and pundits to play Guess Gordon's Election Date. </unknownNode><unknownNode>And you can play online too. Simply tell us which day you think Gordon should go to the country - and, assuming you didn't just pick randomly, how you came to your conclusion. </unknownNode><unknownNode>The first possible date for a general election would be October 18. The latest would be mid-June 2010 - that's if the Prime Minister delays asking permission from the Queen until exactly five years after the last national vote. We've only put Thursdays on our calendar - every post-war vote has been on a Thursday - but there's no law against other days.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Gagging order? The Ministry of Defence has updated its guidelines which some say effectively "gags" soldiers and others in the armed forces. Tonight we'll be asking if this is a reasonable restriction or not. </unknownNode><unknownNode>The latest guidelines specifically say soldiers cannot blog, email or post photographs or videos which relate to  defence matters without specific permission. We know a lot about the problems they've faced in Iraq and Afghanistan through the anonymous postings of British and US soldiers - and I imagine the MOD doesn't like it. </unknownNode><unknownNode>The clarification follows the row over the selling of interviews by two of the Royal Navy personnel held captive in Iran, and the report into media communications that followed. But with two more British soldiers killed yesterday and casualties mounting - will there be online mutiny in the ranks? Join the debate here.   Market turmoil Why did the European Central Bank have to pour jacuzzis of cash into the financial markets to ease a sudden liquidity squeeze? Our Economics Editor, Stephanie Flanders will make it all crystal clear and explain what the "credit crunch" is all about.   The Political Brain And people engage their emotions more than their powers of reason when they decide who to vote for, according to a fascinating new book - The Political Brain - about the science and practice of persuasion in US politics which will be in many politicians' beach bag. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Drew Weston is a professor of psychology and psychiatry who has examined 50 years of American politics - the campaigns that worked and those which didn't. He discovered that a politician can have a perfectly sound raft of policies and facts and figures to back them up - but if there's no emotional connection between he or she and the voter - they are toast. </unknownNode><unknownNode>He demonstrates Clinton's appeal, but why Democrats then voted for Bush and not Kerry. So what would that analysis reveal here? Does Gordon Brown offer reason, whereas David Cameron's appeal might be emotional  - who connects best with the voters? Does Gordon Brown engender the emotion of relief among Labour supporters? Do we make our political judgements in a different way from our American cousins? We'll be speaking to Drew Weston, and with him Rick Nye from Populus. </unknownNode><unknownNode>And Drew Westen's book is the latest addition to the Newsnight Book Club. Read an excerpt and leave your thoughts and reviews here.</unknownNode><unknownNode>In The Political Brain Drew Westen, professor of psychology and psychiatry at Emory University, examines the role of emotion in determining national politics.

They state soldiers can no longer blog, post on bulletin boards, or release video, stills or images.</unknownNode><unknownNode>The government says the new restrictions have been put in place following the controversy over the MoD allowing two navy personnel, captured in Iran, to be paid for their stories.</unknownNode><unknownNode>But through these blogs and video posts (see the Army rumour service board and Live Leak video site - watch Newsnight's recent report about Live Leak) we have learnt of inadequate equipment in theatre, and poor accommodation, as well as unique testimony of soldiers' lives in Afghanistan and Iraq. </unknownNode><unknownNode>So have these restrictions been put in place to quell criticism? Are they legal? Are there good security considerations for the ban? And why, when blogs and video posts have been used by soldiers since the invasion of Iraq in 2003, are the MoD suddenly gagging their personnel?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Let us know what you think.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Foot and mouth We begin tonight with an extraordinary discovery made by the Newsnight team investigating the foot and mouth outbreak. The disease may have been contained by culling, and the ban on cattle movement relaxed, but the Pirbright site could still be vulnerable to another outbreak, and will be so until radical action is taken. We'll explain all tonight and are hoping to put our findings to a government minister.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Krishna Maharaj The 68-year-old British businessman Krishna Maharaj spent 15 years on death row in Florida, and has been in prison there for more than twenty - convicted of a double murder he insits he did not commit.  Jack Straw believes him, so too does Harriet Harman, Peter Hain, the former Attorney Generals Lord Goldsmith and Lord Lyall, London Mayor Ken Livingstone, the Liberal Democrat peer Lord Dholakia and 300 politicians on both sides of the House who are calling for a retrial.  Most importantly, having spent months investigating the case, the Foreign Office says it believes there is "prima facie evidence of a miscarriage of justice." Today Krishna Maharaj, armed with six alibi witnesses, begins his final appeal for clemency. Newsnight's Tim Samuels, who has visited Mr Maharaj in jail many times over the years, interviews him about his last chance for freedom. Read Tim's report here.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Pakistan What is going on in Pakistan? General Musharraf threatens to declare a state of emergency then backs away. Was it a smokescreen for domestic problems and an attempt to delay elections and the introduction of civilian rule? Was it also an excuse for staying at home rather than attending a jirga hosted by President Karzai to talk about dealing with Taliban and Al Qaeda violence, one consequence of which is the deaths of British and US soldiers in Afghanistan? Today President Bush told the Pakistani leader he expected him to take swift action to crack. Our Diplomatic Editor Mark Urban gives us his take on what is probably the most critical region in the world today.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Role models As a government report points the finger at rap artists for providing bad role models for black kids, we'll be dissecting who exactly produces rap, who listens to it, and what effect it really has.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Arctic Who owns the Arctic sea bed? Canada scoffed at the legal significance of Russia's planting of a flag on the oil rich bottom of the Arctic - only to spring into action a week later, attempting to complete an undersea map. The US Geological Survey estimates 25% of the world's undiscovered oil and gas lies in the Arctic. So who does it belong to? We hope we'll be able to tell you tonight.</unknownNode><unknownNode>A viewer, Dan Bindman, has written to say that the Conservative candidate in the Ealing by-election, Tony Lit, wasn&rsquo;t even qualified to stand - at least not under Conservative Party rules.</unknownNode><unknownNode>As everyone knows, Mr Lit only joined the party a few days before he was unveiled as the Tory candidate in Ealing.  Dan points out that under the party rules, a candidate must have belonged to the party for at least three months before he can stand for a Parliamentary election.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>It&rsquo;s all set out in the following document which one can download from the Conservative Party website here.</unknownNode><unknownNode>"Do I need to be a member of the Conservative party to be a candidate?" it asks in one of a series of questions and answers. The response: "We require everyone to be a paid-up member of the party of at least 3 months." Mr Lit made much in his election literature about how he&rsquo;d been personally asked by David Cameron to stand as the candidate.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Perhaps if the Tory leader had obeyed his party rules, and let the local association in Ealing pick their contender (in line with his commitment to devolving power), he would have faced a lot less grief.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Iraq Tonight we open with an exclusive investigation by our Diplomatic Editor into Iranian involvement in, and leadership of, attacks on British and US forces in Iraq. Mark Urban has high level intelligence pointing to the use of bombs designed with Iranian technology - one of which killed a British soldier. Add to that accusations that large numbers of Iraqi insurgents have been trained in Iran and one question for tonight is whether these actions are sanctioned by the Iranian government.  This comes as The Washington Post reports a senior US Intelligence figure as saying British forces have been beaten in Basra - where the Iranians are said to be active in fuelling the increasing violence.  I'll be asking John Bolton, the former US ambassador to the UN and the Democratic Presidential candidate Dennis Kucinich, how the West should be dealing with Iran      .   Foot and mouth Tests have been carried out on all the drains at the Pirbright site, encompassing both the Institute of Animal Health and the Merial Laboratory, in an effort to discover the source of the outbreak of Foot and Mouth, and they are being sent to the government tonight. In developments today, the Chief Vet confirmed she is ordering the culling of cattle on an adjacent farm in Surrey - though it appears to be a precautionary measure rather than the response to any sign of the disease. She also announced a relaxation on of the ban on the movement of livestock in England and Wales, following the relaxation in Scotland. We'll bring you the latest on the tests.   Undercover mosque In the latest episode in the TV "fakery" saga - the editing of a Channel Four programme Undercover Mosque has led to a formal complaint to Ofcom by West Midlands Police.  The commissioning editor of the series Kevin Sutcliffe defended the programme saying he believed 'the comments made in this film speak for themselves - several speakers were clearly shown making abhorrent and extreme comments."  However Abu Usamah, one of the preachers featured in the programme, said "to try and demonise the efforts of these people by taking their comments out of context was shocking."  Who is right? Tonight we hope to bring together a leading member of the mosque in question with Kevin Sutcliffe of Channel Four.   Ethanol And could corn become the fuel of the future?

(Read my article here or watch the film here.) Until early this year, Jassim was working for the British military in Basra.  He has continuously served alongside British soldiers since the start of the Iraqi conflict in 2003.  But when a friend and fellow translator was kidnapped and decapitated, and Jassim received a death threat sent as a text message to his mobile phone, he knew he had to leave Iraq.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>He arrived in Damascus clutching a stack of letters of recommendation from senior officers in a number of different British army regiments.  They praise his hard work and bravery.  But despite such commendations, he receives no support from his former employer.  The British Embassy in Damascus refuses to let him in to even discuss his situation.</unknownNode><unknownNode>I wanted to find out whether things have improved since the media coverage.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had no luck with visas,&rdquo; he tells me.  &ldquo;They still won&rsquo;t talk to us.  We&rsquo;re stuck here and we&rsquo;re not allowed to work.&rdquo;</unknownNode><unknownNode>The situation facing Jassim and his colleagues hasn&rsquo;t received much attention in Britain &ndash; from the media or from politicians.  By contrast, this is now a big issue in the United States.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>The Washington Post has published a leaked memo written by the current US Ambassador to Iraq, Ryan Crocker.  In it, he calls on the US State Department to grant immigrant visas to all Iraqis currently employed by the Americans.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>&ldquo;Unless they know that there is some hope of an [immigrant visa] in the future, many will continue to seek asylum, leaving our Mission lacking in one of our most valuable assets,&rdquo; he writes.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Meanwhile, Senator Edward Kennedy has pushed legislation through Capitol Hill to deliver more visas for the translators.

The Danish government will soon withdraw its 470 troops from Iraq.  It recently emerged that, prompted by political pressure, they have secretly airlifted to Denmark the 200 Iraqi translators, and their families, who worked alongside them.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>Gordon Brown has said that any recommendation on the future role of Britain&rsquo;s troops in Iraq could be put to Parliament after the summer recess.

This curious irony may seem less of a curious irony if you're a farmer. Many of them just find it outrageous the country's facing the disease once again. We're about to learn the exact source of the virus. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Currently, the investigation is focusing on a private pharmaceutical company - Merial - which makes the vaccine for use in other countries - and the government-run Institute for Animal Health. There's even a suggestion flooding may have caused the outbreak. Inevitably, questions of whether to vaccinate cattle instead of cull them have now become more prescient. But even those who favour inoculation admit this outbreak is something of an &ldquo;own goal&rdquo;. We'll be discussing the impact this is likely to have on the way we handle the disease here longer term.</unknownNode><unknownNode>BAA The company has been accused by protesters, of &ldquo;legal bullying&rdquo;, since it won a partial injunction from the High Court banning some environmental campaigners from creating a camp outside the airport. Protesters are fighting the planned third runway at Heathrow which they say will do incalculable damage to people living in the developing world through climate change. BAA argues the camp will create a security risk at a time of heightened terror alert and heavy passenger flow. But is the airport authority using the cover of security to silence those who make life uncomfortable for it? We'll be debating with both sides tonight.    Campsfield A breakout at an immigration centre, with convicts on the loose: if only this were a new story. Unfortunately it's not. Campsfield's problems began just six months after it opened, in 1993, when six detainees broke out after a rooftop protest. In 1997 a report warned the centre was unsafe.  In 2003, another warning that it was not a place of safety. And tonight, as I write, 14 convicted criminals are still on the run. Why has so little improved despite the warnings? Does the heavy campaigning of some local residents to have it shut down completely have anything to do with it?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Peru's war zone workers Peru may seem utterly remote from the war on terror. In fact it's linked in a way that appears to be quite shocking. Young Peruvian men are being recruited to help protect coalition staff and troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. They are attracted by the relatively generous salaries - but many pay a heavy price. We meet some of those who have sustained horrific injuries and who are now battling for compensation. How did the war on terror become so globalized?  And why, despite international condemnation, are these men still being employed in these dangerous roles? Paul Mason and Fernando Lucena bring us their stories.</unknownNode><unknownNode>From tonight's presenter, Kirsty Wark:</unknownNode><unknownNode>DARFUR We begin tonight with Sudan as the myriad Darfur rebel factions arrive in Tanzania for UN sponsored negotiations ahead of peace talks with the Sudanese government. After what was described by some in the media as Gordon Brown and Nicolas Sarkozy's diplomatic triumph of agreeing to send troops to Sudan, we examine the challenges facing the UN over its resolution on Darfur. Is there the international will to make it work?     Christian Aid has told Newsnight that the UN mandate is weak and the wording gives the Sudanese Government the chance to wriggle out of their commitments. They feel it could take over nine months to deploy the 26,000 peacekeeping troops and there isn't enough of a sense of urgency. Marry that to a seemingly reluctant support for the plan from Sudan's president who only last week accused Britain and the US of overplaying the problem in Darfur. I'll be interviewing the Sudanese Ambassador to the UN live.  Key Darfur rebel to boycott talks   REPOSSESSIONS The number of home repossessions in Britain has risen by an extraordinary 30% in the first half of the year compared to the same period in 2006.

Have crucial parts of the draft European Treaty been lost in translation or not? How different is this draft treaty - published now in English - from the old one, and do the changes justify the government decision to abandon its manifesto commitment on a referendum? Political Editor Michael Crick investigates and then the Europe Minister Jim Murphy goes head-to-head with his political shadow, Mark Francois, over the issue of a referendum.</unknownNode><unknownNode>POLITICAL BLOGS Some may describe Newsnight's daily e-mail as a bit of a blog but it&rsquo;s only an infinitesimal part of the vast blogging universe.

He first claimed his actions were to aid his research for a new comedy series, and then said he was abused as a child, and felt an empathy with the children in the images. What will be the impact of such a high profile conviction on others who download images of child abuse - if any? And how do we break through to the thousands of people who are in denial about the reasons for their shocking actions? Actor convicted over child porn</unknownNode><unknownNode>MENEZES There was yet more sadness today for the family of Jean Charles de Menezes with the extraordinary revelation that off-duty police officers at a cricket match knew of fears that an innocent man had been shot dead by police before the head of the Metropolitan Police was told. In fact, according to the Independent Police Complaints Commission report which was published today, the head of The Met, Sir Ian Blair, was almost totally uninformed of events following the death of Mr Menezes. Robin Denselow delves into the report. Anti-terror police "misled" public  </unknownNode><unknownNode>US BRIDGE The Mississippi River in Minneapolis is a scene of devastation. It follows the collapse of a major bridge, a crucial artery, at evening rush hour which sent cars and people tumbling in an avalanche of concrete and steel. So far four people have died and dozens are still missing. But it could have been even worse had four of the eight lanes not been closed for repairs. We will be looking at the science of bridges and what structural engineers and architects need to consider to avoid these types of disasters.

At the end of Blair&rsquo;s first week in the region as envoy for the Middle East Quartet, Israelis and Palestinians are now left contemplating the gap between hype and hope.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Blair said he felt a &ldquo;sense of possibility&rdquo;.  But the grounds for optimism were left unexplained.  Israel&rsquo;s politicians were positive, adopting a strategy they openly describe as &ldquo;hug him close&rdquo;.  Israel&rsquo;s press is enjoying the publicity.  &ldquo;An international rock star is now dealing with the Israeli-Palestinian peace process,&rdquo; claims Haaretz.  Palestinian reaction was more muted.   &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t about Tony Blair, this is about us,&rdquo; the new Palestinian Prime Minister, Salaam Fayad, told the BBC.  And, at least according to Blair&rsquo;s job description, he&rsquo;s right.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>The remit provided by the Middle East Quartet - made up of the EU, the United States, the UN and Russia - limits Blair&rsquo;s role to Palestinian economic development, good governance and the raising of international aid.  This isn&rsquo;t about summits and peace negotiations, it&rsquo;s about getting the Palestinians to a position where a viable state becomes plausible.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Khaled, a falafel seller in the Balata refugee camp near Nablus, isn&rsquo;t convinced about Blair&rsquo;s commitment.  &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a loser,&rdquo; he told me. &ldquo;He did nothing to help the Palestinians when he was Prime Minister, when he had power.  Why do you think he can help now?&rdquo; </unknownNode><unknownNode>Ashraf Misre from Nablus would like a piece of Tony&rsquo;s time.  He often struggles to reach his different businesses because of restrictions on movement imposed by the Israelis.  They say checkpoints are necessary for security.  But for Ashraf and his wife Nisreen, the unpredictability involved in travelling short distances is a basic impediment to building his business.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>What Israelis and Palestinians seem unclear about is whether Blair will stick to his limited mandate.  Will he get stuck into the problems faced by entrepreneurs like Ashraf or will he end up involved in mediation between Ehud Olmert and Mahmoud Abbas?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Unlike in Northern Ireland, Blair may find his freedom of movement curtailed.  There are many players on this stage.  Briefings by the American government have been clear: they will take the lead on major diplomatic negotiations. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Domino's PizzaIt's been called one of the worst cases of worker exploitation. The Transport and General Workers Union claims Hungarian migrants employed at Domino's Pizza franchises in Derby have taken home virtually no pay for months because of illegal deductions from their wages. Tonight we put these allegations to Domino's Pizza live on the programme.</unknownNode><unknownNode>FloodsAfter the week of some of the worst flooding since records began in Britain there is a new appreciation of what some of the poorest people in the world face. We don't normally report the flooding in many of the world's countries but tonight we have reports from three other countries where flooding is devastating people's lives. And the causes are surprisingly similar to the ones you'll find in Britain - Victorian drains, building developments in the wrong place and cities built round the meeting points of big rivers. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Russian YouthAnd while the coming week will see mass celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of scouting in Russia more than 10,000 will gather for a very different youth movement.

And, if so, does Islam need its own Reformation?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Or is the crisis a response to Western governments' attempts to influence, or even control, Muslim-majority nations?

But what happens when things appear to return to normal? </unknownNode><unknownNode>Today, the sun is out in parts of the country and the levels are beginning to recede. But for the thousands still stranded, homeless, and without supplies, it will be a long haul to dry land. We revisit the parts of Hull that suffered so badly last month and ask the government what future lessons will be learned from all this.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Vivisection</unknownNode><unknownNode>If you're a monkey and you have electrodes inserted in your brain, you may well take issue with the government describing the procedure as &ldquo;moderate&rdquo;. Indeed, you don't have to be a monkey. </unknownNode><unknownNode>A campaign group called the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection is taking the government to court to argue the fate of lab animals and has accused it of failing in its duty to keep suffering to a minimum. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Is there enough evidence of the benefits to human health to justify this type of experimentation? We'll be debating that in the studio later with a surgeon who tests on animals and then uses the results to cure people.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Translators</unknownNode><unknownNode>Hundreds of local Iraqi translators risk their lives for the British military and the Foreign Office in places where our troops are stationed.  They work - often in fear - and too often for little in return. What should this country be offering them? Tonight, David Loyn brings us their story. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Pay Gap</unknownNode><unknownNode>It sounds like a cracked record. It is, in fact, a cracked record: Women fly our planes, fight in our armed forces, run our hospitals, run our country, fill our television screens etc etc etc. Yet the pay gap between them and their male counterparts won't go away. Why not?  </unknownNode><unknownNode>FloodsI am writing this in the dark. Because of a pan BBC systems failure. Indeed I am actually writing it by hand, at present, because of a pan BBC systems failure. Curiously, though, this plays into what feels like a return to biblical times. Floods, thousands displaced, water supplies and electricity supplies cut and the threat of worse to come. And this is Tewkesbury, not Bangalore.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>So tonight, there are no prizes for guessing our focus. The Met office warned of floods in no uncertain terms. Yet this country has failed to cope - why? Have we been spending money on the wrong things? Can this government realistically go ahead with building plans which include housing on flood plains?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Changing WeatherAnd of course the wider issue: Be you a sceptic or a card-carrying member of the climate change argument this amount of rain makes the issue slightly tricky to ignore. We'll be asking whether this is ever more proof of our world getting wilder or just another twist in a complex weather cycle which shouldn&rsquo;t be over interpreted.</unknownNode><unknownNode>ToriesDavid Cameron's in Rwanda whilst there are these problems at home. And he's getting a fair amount of stick for it. Not least because there are murmurings within his own party that it may be time to change his style - or should we say policies - and stop isolating the right wing of the party. And after a poor showing in the by-elections last week when the Tories came third in each seat, those murmurings may gain a stronger foothold. Is he in trouble?

Others aren't feeling quite so warm spirited about an inquiry that went on for 16 months, cost a million pounds, threatened to bring down a government, and ultimately yielded no charges. Last night the BBC broke the story that no-one would be prosecuted in the Cash for Honours investigation. Today, with the confirmation, came many, many questions. Was it, as some claim, a political stunt by the SNP? Why did police drag it out for so long if evidence was so scant? Was the decision by the CPS not to prosecute the right one? And where does this leave party funding, and indeed party reputations going forward? We've got a panel of those involved together and the discussion promises to be pretty heated. Blair 'pleased' at honours ruling</unknownNode><unknownNode>By-election</unknownNode><unknownNode>It will be hard to think of the MP for Sedgefield as being anyone other than Tony Blair. But as from today, there is a new one. Phil Wilson won the by-election pretty comfortably for Labour, which also won in Southall and Ealing.  So will two early successes for Gordon Brown give him the confidence to face the polls early for a General Election? We'll be discussing the implications of these results tonight with our hot political panel of familiar faces. Tories shrug off by-election blow </unknownNode><unknownNode>By tonight&rsquo;s presenter, Emily Maitlis:</unknownNode><unknownNode>No Rushn We waited. We waited. And we waited. When the response from Russia finally came, it looked rather like the one we'd expected from day one. Putin has expelled four UK diplomats from Russia: An exact tit-for-tat retaliation for the expulsions Britain announced on Monday. So will this escalate the diplomatic tensions between Britain and Russia? And what exactly do they mean by threatening to withdraw support from the &ldquo;war on terror&rdquo;?</unknownNode><unknownNode>One theory suggests Russia was checking out the international reaction to Britain's moves before it responded. With a certain irony, today will mark Tony Blair's first day in the job as Middle East Envoy. One of his bosses, so to speak, in The Quartet will be Putin, no less. We&rsquo;ll be examining the way foreign policy is shifting under a Brown government as Foreign Secretary David Miliband launches what he's calling a &ldquo;new diplomacy&rdquo;. Russia expels four UK diplomats</unknownNode><unknownNode>Weed It's a funny old thing, cannabis. One day politicians can't deny their drug taking adamantly enough. The next, they're all leaping on the bandwagon of admission in a &ldquo;me too&rdquo; spirit. Jacqui Smith, our Home Secretary, admitted she smoked it at university. Now the Chancellor Alistair Darling - once labelled the most boring man in politics - has forced us to let our minds run wild imagining him, spliff tightly rolled, little finger lightly lifted, taking a good ole drag. So tonight we're asking, does anyone really care any more? Would you admit past demeanours if you were now in a job of substance? Which euphemism would you employ to come clean? We'll talk to Tim Yeo from the Conservatives who refreshingly admitted he took it and enjoyed it.     Top ministers admit cannabis use</unknownNode><unknownNode>By-election  We'll have the latest from Michael Crick at the hotly-contested Ealing Southall by-election, and from the count in Sedgefield - both are key tests for all three main parties. By-election voters head to polls</unknownNode><unknownNode>Cage fighting And... fear not. We are onto the fastest growing sport - allegedly - in the world. It involves two men and a cage. And it looks fairly brutal. One practitioner we talk to is a preacher. Maybe the prayers come in handy. And in the spirit of Newsnight, our Culture Correspondent Steve Smith widens the niche market to ask Steven Berkoff why he's so attracted to the pastime of punching another's lights out. He claims Ian McKellan, Michael Gambon and other stalwarts of the stage are limbering up to join him. He's joking. We think. </unknownNode><unknownNode>By tonight's presenter, Gavin Esler:</unknownNode><unknownNode>Trust?

Brown is not Blair Another attempt to distance himself from the Blair years today from Gordon Brown - opening up the possibility of re-classifying cannabis as a harder drug than at present.

Russia warns UK over expulsions</unknownNode><unknownNode>Inequality Several reports out today claim that inequality now is much worse than 20 or 30 years ago. One tool that the government hoped would tackle the opportunity gap - SureStart - also came in for criticism. MPs said it was failing to target those who most need it. So what is the government doing to tackle the problem?

How much of your household rubbish do you recycle? Across Britain, it's a mere 20% - making us the second worst recyclers in Europe. A committee of MPs described the government's recycling policy as "too timid" today. We've been to Austria - where 68% of household waste is recycled, and there are bold plans virtually to eliminate landfill sites. </unknownNode><unknownNode>So...Boris Johnson has confirmed that he'll enter the race to be Tory candidate for Mayor of London.

A jury in Chicago found him guilty on four of the13 counts against him. Lord Black controlled a media empire - including the Daily Telegraph - through Hollinger International, a company based in Chicago. He was convicted of defrauding the other shareholders in this company by taking millions of dollars in fees which he wasn't entitled to. He was also convicted of obstructing justice by removing boxes of documents from his office. He's said he'll appeal against the verdicts.

In just 10 minutes, the Prime Minister Gordon Brown got rid of centuries of tradition, by announcing a whole raft of Queen's speech legislation without, indeed, the Queen. Michael Crick will be looking at Gordon's "blueprint", and why he's decided to announce it now. </unknownNode><unknownNode>The Prime Minister's main focus - first and foremost - was on housing. He pledged to build three million new houses by 2020 and said the government would release 550 publicly-owned, brownfield sites for housing development. Few dispute the difficulties many face getting on the property ladder when supply is so squeezed. But the big question - which we will tackle head on tonight with the three main parties - is where, exactly, will they build and will it be enough?</unknownNode><unknownNode>SUPERCASINO CLIMB DOWN?No less controversial was Gordon Brown's implicit suggestion that the super-casino programme needed a rethink, possibly even a u-turn. He raised concerns about whether super-casinos are the best way to regenerate badly deprived areas. Paul Mason delves into the mystery of the missing casinos.   </unknownNode><unknownNode>RUSSIA'S FAR EASTA sparsely populated bit of Russia - in the far far east of the country - is seeing an influx of neighbouring Chinese. For China, this part of Russia is an empty land of opportunity rich in minerals and trading possibilities. But is its destiny Asian?

City officials have launched an advertising campaign encouraging people to drink tap water - which they say cuts down on waste and saves on transport. What about us in Britain? We&rsquo;ll look at the environmental cost of bottled water and the cultural embarrassment in restaurants of asking for tap water. We'll also speak to the drinks manufacturers live to see what they're doing to reduce their carbon footprint.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Do you ask for tap water in restaurants?

No sooner has the British government called off a Serious Fraud Office investigation into their arms sales to Saudi Arabia than the Americans have stepped in with their own inquiry. Meanwhile, British fraud investigators are still looking into BAE's deals in six other countries, including billions of pounds in sales to South Africa. Peter Marshall has been investigating the South African deal - and how it's brought rancour and suspicion to the new democracy.  </unknownNode><unknownNode> New Yorkers are being urged to switch to tap water for fear of the effect that the bottled stuff is having on the environment.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Environmental campaigners say that four out of five plastic water bottles end up in landfill sites, and the distribution process sometimes sees water being shipped halfway around the world.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Britons, too, have gone mad for bottled water in recent years.  But has this led to a general snobbery associated with H2O?  Would you now feel too embarrassed to ask for tap water in a restaurant, for example, opting to pay for bottled instead?  Or do you regularly fly in the face of convention and request the free stuff?  Have you ever asked for tap water and been refused?  And is it time we were offered the choice of "tap or bottled" rather than "still or sparkling"?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Watch the Newsnight report and interview with an industry spokesman here.</unknownNode><unknownNode>21/ 7There have been four guilty verdicts on the 21/7 bomb plotters.

Jackie Long has spent eight weeks with a group of kids and their families on a testing programme, designed to re-educate them about healthy eating.

In the last few months we have lost both Renton and Douglas Dodds-Parker, as well as John Profumo (who was elected under Neville Chamberlain in 1940, but lost in 1945).  Those remaining are Michael Foot, John Freeman, and Francis Noel-Baker (two of whom, Freeman and Noel-Baker, now live overseas).  </unknownNode><unknownNode>David Renton, who served as MP for Huntingdon from 1945 to 1979 (handing the seat over the John Major), and then in the Lords until his death, could also boast of being the longest continuous serving Parliamentarian of the last century to have served in both houses - a run of 62 years.  So who now takes the title of longest-serving Parliamentarian to have served both houses?  At a guess I would say it was Denis Healey, who first elected as an MP at a by-election in 1952, served in the Commons until 1992, and has sat in the Lords ever since.  But please let me know if anyone can boast longer continuous service to both houses.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>But perhaps the most astionishing record is held by the former Foreign Secretary Lord Carrington.  He never sat in the Commons, but has sat in the Lords since 1940 - 67 years.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Presented by Emily Maitlis.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Live Earth</unknownNode><unknownNode>&ldquo;Would you,&rdquo; one viewer asked &ldquo;hold a hog roast to promote vegetarianism?&rdquo;  The analogy takes a moment.

No borrowed rock star villa in Barbados for him. Unfortunately, the man in charge of sanctioning the final touches to the Government of Talents is vacationing as we speak.

It has always been an utterly useless part of the male wardrobe. But now, it seems to me, the only people who wear the things daily are male politicians, the male reporters who interview them - and dodgy estate agents. </unknownNode><unknownNode> Of course, there are things to be said in their favour. I was talking to a psychiatrist the other day. He was wearing a tie. I wasn&rsquo;t. I asked him why he still trussed himself up. He said that there were lots of patients who expected doctors to have something round their necks. It made them think he knew what he was talking about.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Well, we all need help in that department. </unknownNode><unknownNode> 						Continue reading "Time to go tie-less?" 					</unknownNode><unknownNode>Tonight's programme is presented by Jeremy Paxman.</unknownNode><unknownNode>INTEREST RATES The cost of borrowing is going up again. The Bank of England has raised the interest rate by a quarter of one per cent to five and three quarters percent. Why have interest rates gone up now and who or what is responsible? Our Economics Editor, Stephanie Flanders will give us the benefit of her analysis. We hope to be joined by senior politicians from all main parties to discuss the state of the UK economy and  whether we can cope with a record &pound;1.3 trillion level of personal debt.</unknownNode><unknownNode>FLOODS The government has made clear that it's considering, "as a matter of urgency", extra funding for those areas hit by last week's floods. In Hull, thousands of people are struggling to cope with what has been described by the local authority as a &ldquo;humanitarian disaster&rdquo; after the city was deluged with two months of rain in just 12 hours. The local council says its resources have been overwhelmed and it's accused ministers of ignoring their plight. Our Science Editor Susan Watts is on the case. The Department of Environment says it&rsquo;s responsible for sorting out the damage. But Susan is finding that it's difficult to pin down who out of the agencies and local authorities on the ground is really in charge. We hope to bring together the Leader of Hull City Council and a government minister to discuss what should be done.</unknownNode><unknownNode>SCHOOL SWAP Earlier this year on Newsnight we teamed up with our colleagues at BBC Look North in Yorkshire and started a project called Bradford United - with two groups of 15-year-olds reporting on life at two different schools in the city.

This week, we got the two groups together for the first time to tell us about their experiences with a different community - and at a different school.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Click here to read about and watch the original report</unknownNode><unknownNode>QUARRYMEN It's 50 years this week since a very young Paul McCartney first met John Lennon and his band The Quarrymen. As Liverpool celebrates, Peter Marshall reports on a day that changed music for ever. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Alan Johnston is freeAfter 114 days, the wait is over.  We all woke up this morning to the fantastic news that our colleague Alan Johnston was released from captivity in the early hours of this morning.  Alan himself has been extraordinary - composed, dignified and characteristically self-effacing - as he's  talked today about both his ordeal and his first few hours of freedom.  Tonight, we will bring you his story - in his words.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>We will also look at what happened behind the scenes to secure his release.  Hamas has clearly played a significant role in achieving this and have said that they would like "recognition" for what they've done. So what might this mean for future diplomatic relations with them? </unknownNode><unknownNode>Politics of terrorLast night on Newsnight we heard how a former member of Hizb ut Tahrir had been in close contact with one of those suspected of carrying out the attack on Glasgow Airport. Now today in his first Prime Minister's Questions Gordon Brown was asked why the controversial organisation Hizb ut Tahrir hasn't been banned. Gordon Brown said he would look at the evidence. Meanwhile John Reid, the former Home Secretary apparently decided Gordon Brown needed a little help and intervened to urge the Prime Minister to stick with his decision that, based on the evidence, the group shouldn't be banned. Newsnight's Richard Watson has been monitoring Hizb ut Tahrir's activities over several years and will be assessing the arguments for and against. </unknownNode><unknownNode>PMQsThe moment both sides had been waiting for as Gordon Brown and David Cameron met at the Despatch Box for their first Prime Minister's Questions.

We'll be asking Jack Straw what it is all about.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Pardon Me President Bush</unknownNode><unknownNode>Yesterday Scooter Libby had a let off.   President Bush ensured that he did not go to jail. Remember Scooter was the Vice President's Chief of Staff convicted after the wife of Ambassador Wilson was outed as a CIA agent. Tonight we hear from that Ambassador - Joe Wilson - about why he is not happy with the President's actions.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Environment Agency</unknownNode><unknownNode>And The "Polluter Pays"&hellip;  it's a guiding principle of today's environment laws.  But has the Environment Agency - still reeling from criticism over its handling of the floods - also blown its chance to force one of the world's largest chemicals companies to pay for pollution dumped here in the UK - leaving the British tax payer to foot a multi million pound bill? Susan Watts has an exclusive report.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>TerrorForeign jihadists, not home grown terrorists? What difference does it make?  We'll have the latest on the fast moving investigation into the terror attacks in London and Glasgow, and we'll also be assessing the motives behind the attacks. Is there really a link to British foreign policy? Or - given that a nightclub was the target of one of the London attacks, and a previous bomb plot targeted The Ministry of Sound - are these attacks primarily directed against the western way of life? We hope to be speaking to leading politicians and a former jihadist about what can be done.   Trouble for the Tories?Are the Conservatives stuck in a rut? As the Gordon  Brown / New Labour re-launch gives way to the current terrorist attacks, can the Tories get any political traction at all? Why are they stuck at less than 40% in the opinion polls? And is there anything David Cameron can do about it in the Shadow Cabinet re-shuffle tonight?  Michael Crick is on the case.   SpinvoxWhen the boss of a UK company says "we're going to be the next billion dollar startup" there are inevitably weary groans from those who remember the dotcom boom and bust. But is this technology boom different? Paul Mason has been following the progress of Spinvox, a UK startup company, to find out what it's really like to raise and spend &pound;30 million of other people's money.</unknownNode><unknownNode>The UK security level is currently at its highest - 'critical' - following the three attempted car bomb attacks over the last few days.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Counter-terrorism experts are working on the assumption that the failed attacks are connected - at least ideologically - to al-Qaeda and recent intelligence has suggested jihadists were planning an attack in Britain.</unknownNode><unknownNode>So how do we deal with the threat of jihadis in this country? What do you think?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Perhaps the biggest surprise in the Cabinet reshuffle was former Newsnight producer Shaun Woodward as Northern Ireland Secretary, though I can't help feeling it's no longer really a full Cabinet job. Peter Hain, after all, combined Northern Ireland with Wales, and that was before Stormont got going again this May, which presumably means there&rsquo;s now a lot less to do. Still, Shaun Woodward has offered to do the job for free.  Given that he only quite the Conservative Party less than eight years ago, the recent defection of Quentin Davies (watch his Newsnight appearance here) and the promise of further Tory recruits, perhaps Mr Woodward&rsquo;s real role is as minister to encourage defections. </unknownNode><unknownNode>And Gordon Brown displayed a certain ruthlessness in not placing two of his closest allies round the cabinet table.  Nick Brown has to make do with being Deputy Chief Whip, having held the job of Chief Whip a few years ago, though he&rsquo;s now been made Minister for the North as well, and claims to be happy.   And what has Stephen Timms, formerly Brown&rsquo;s number two as Chief Secretary to the Treasury, done to deserve demotion?  He&rsquo;s now lost his Cabinet place to become minister of state at the ludicrously named Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>Then we had the rather underwhelming parade of &ldquo;all the talents&rdquo; &ndash; four people from outside politics who&rsquo;ve agreed to become junior ministers: Sir Mark Malloch Brown, Sir Digby Jones, Sir Ara Darsi and Sir Alan West.  They&rsquo;ll all become lords, though it&rsquo;s interesting that they&rsquo;re all already knights of the realm, and both Malloch Brown and Darsi had agreed to join the Labour Party.  Sir Alan West told me he hadn&rsquo;t yet decided whether to join Labour (and given his Home Office security job he&rsquo;s got more pressing things to consider right now), while Digby Jones insists (contrary to what I said on Newsnight on Thursday) that he won&rsquo;t be joining Labour, despite Gordon Brown asking him to do so.  Indeed, Sir Digby won&rsquo;t even say if he&rsquo;ll vote Labour in future, though once he becomes a lord, his ability to vote will be confined to non-Westminster elections.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>The reshuffle of the lower ranks was extremely dull.  Indeed, there are so few interesting changes and so few dramatic new names that one almost gets the impression that Gordon Brown was so diverted by the car bombs on Friday that he got fed up with the reshuffle and simply decided most people could carry on doing what they did before.   There are a handful of appointments from the 2005 intake, such as Shahid Malik (the first Muslim minister), and the former Treasury civil servant Helen Goodman (a former girlfriend of Tory Education spokesman David Willetts), but the list is more notable for the unusual number of retreads &ndash; including Angela Eagle, Michael Wills and Joan Ruddock.  And despite reducing the number of women in Cabinet from eight to five, Gordon Brown&rsquo;s government now contains 38 women in all, which must be an all-time record.   </unknownNode><unknownNode>Interesting to see a Manchester United fan, Gerry Sutcliffe, has been made Minister for Sport (though he also supports Bradford City).  I hope he realises it&rsquo;s a bit of an end-of-the-line job &ndash; how many sports ministers since the post was created in 1964 have ever gone on to anything higher?  None, so far as I can remember.  But perhaps Mr Sutcliffe can now do something about securing an honour for one of United&rsquo;s all-time greats, Denis Law, who was also recently voted the greatest Scotland player of all time.  In a world where even the most mediocre of footballers seems to get an honour these days, Denis hasn&rsquo;t even had an MBE.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>Kirsty Wark is joined by Paul Morley, Miranda Sawyer and John Harris for a special extended programme from the Manchester International Festival.</unknownNode><unknownNode>The panel will be reviewing: Monkey:Journey to the West, a circus opera based on the most famous of the Chinese myth cycles, the fable of the monkey king - now reinvented by Damon Albarn, Jamie Hewlett and Chen Shi- Zheng; an intriguing theatre experience by Johnny Vegas and Stewart Lee called Interiors; Perverted by Languange - a book of short fiction inspired by Manchester band The Fall (Steve Smith then speaks to namesake and singer Mark E, read more about that here); Lou Reed's British premiere of his dark, drug-infested narrative album Berlin; and the film Shrek the Third.</unknownNode><unknownNode>More about all those here - leave your reviews and comments below.</unknownNode><unknownNode>London bombWho was trying to blow up central London - and why?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Tonight we bring you all the very latest on the bid to target the capital with a car bomb. The details we have are quite unnerving. A vehicle packed with explosives that might never have been noticed had not an ambulance crew been called to the scene for a completely unrelated matter. Twelve hours on - all we're being told is that the device was potentially viable and could have caused carnage. But do security services know more about this operation than they're letting on to us? We hope to talk to those at the Home Office later. </unknownNode><unknownNode>CabinetThose at the Home Office of course have only been in the job twenty four hours. Indeed some of them appeared - disarmingly - in news conferences today before they had even technically been announced. </unknownNode><unknownNode>A former top police chief will be advising Gordon Brown on international security issues, a former First Sea Lord will be Home Office Minister for Security. The new PM did promise a government of "all the talents" but what do his long suffering Labour MPs - who didn't make the cabinet - make of all this parachuting? Michael Crick is on the case and we'll be talking to our political panel to give us their take on an extraordinary week in British politics. </unknownNode><unknownNode>SmokingAnd with only two days to go before the smoking ban comes into force in England, we ask if the tobacco companies themselves are worried about falling revenues. Experience of the Irish ban suggests they still know exactly who to target and how to keep smoking numbers up. So how do they do it?   </unknownNode><unknownNode>By programme producer Simon Enright.</unknownNode><unknownNode>New CabinetTonight the challenge of change has begun. Gordon Brown has kept in post only one of Tony Blair's cabinet. He's got the first female Home Secretary, two brothers and a husband and wife team all attending cabinet. Jeremy has promised to make sure that he goes through the whole cabinet so you feel fully informed. Michael Crick will explain what it all means. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Foreign SecretaryFor the 41 year old David Miliband quite a daunting task - Foreign Secretary. Mark Urban assesses the challenge for the youngest foreign minister in 30 years. And we'll speak to a panel of "all the talents" to see what they think this all means. </unknownNode><unknownNode>FloodAs parts of England prepare for another weekend of rain we speak to the boss of the Environment Agency - Baroness Young. Has her agency done enough to stop the flood waters? </unknownNode><unknownNode>Manchester International FestivalFinally today is the start of the Manchester International Festival. Tomorrow Kirsty hosts Newsnight Review from the city. Ahead of that, tonight we interview "Manchester Man" Tony Wilson - the original 24 hour party person. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Join Jeremy at 2230.</unknownNode><unknownNode>"So you'll be the first set of brothers in Cabinet since the Stanleys," I teased Ed Miliband the other evening, referring to the speculation that he would soon join his brother David in the new Gordon Brown Cabinet.  Ed Miliband brushed my question off, of course, but then, once the camera was switched off, enquired eagerly: "Who were the Stanleys?"</unknownNode><unknownNode>Answer: the two sons of the seventeenth Earl of Derby, who sat in Cabinet together in 1938, under Neville Chamberlian.  Lord (Edward) Stanley, was Dominions Secretary, while his younger brother Oliver Stanley, was President of the Board of Trade.  It is not a happy precedent, however, since Lord (Edward) Stanley died only a few months after taking the job. </unknownNode><unknownNode>A more interesting pair of Cabinet brothers served after the war, though not simultanously, since they were on opposite sides of politics. Earl of Listowel briefly served for four months as Secretary of State for India in 1947, during Clement Attlee's post-war Labour Cabinet, whilst his brother John Hare (later Lord Blakenham) held posts in the early '60s, in the Cabinets of Harold Macmillan and Alec Douglas-Home.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Gordon Brown has said that he wants to have a government of "all the talents". </unknownNode><unknownNode>We've heard there are some surprises to come - we already know that he's asked Alan Sugar to advise him on business.</unknownNode><unknownNode>At the weekend, George Clooney was suggested to advise on education and Jennifer Lopez on International Development. </unknownNode><unknownNode>We want your "talent" and the jobs they should do.

All Labour MPs had at least two votes - one as an MP, and one as an ordinary party member - and many of them had other votes as members of affiliated trades unions and socialist societies.  Indeed one deputy leadership contender admitted to me that they had eight votes last week - as an MP, a party member, a meber of two unions, and four affiliated societies.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>I'd be fascinated to know if anybody could boast of even more votes than that.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Presented by Jeremy Paxman</unknownNode><unknownNode>TORY DEFECTOR </unknownNode><unknownNode>"Under your leadership the Conservative Party appears to me to have ceased collectively to believe in anything or to stand for anything".

He'll have to decide whether to pass on crucial documents which could aid the inquiry, but damage the British government.</unknownNode><unknownNode> BROWN ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL </unknownNode><unknownNode>And - he's been compared to Stalin by one man that worked closely with him. So has Gordon Brown been trying to cultivate a warmer style of politics? The independent film-maker Jamie Campbell has been following the new Prime Minister for the past month on the campaign trail, in a bid to engage him in a conversation.  Watch to see if he succeeds.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt</unknownNode><unknownNode>It&rsquo;s summit season in Sharm el-Sheikh.  The tourists on the beach, flown in on charter flights from Manchester, Moscow and Berlin, are oblivious to the political scrum taking place nearby.  Inside the congress centre, President Mubarak of Egypt is hosting Israeli PM Ehud Olmert, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and King Abdullah of Jordan.   Outside journalists from across the region are sprawled on a small patch of grass.  Hours and hours of airtime are devoted to a meeting lasting just under three.  In the 45 degree heat, the media pour out sweat and speculation.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>That summit clich&eacute; - the stakes are high &ndash; is true.  The leaders are here to discuss how to bolster President Abbas and his Fatah party after the recent takeover of the Gaza Strip by their opponents Hamas.  The rise of Hamas has put &lsquo;moderate&rsquo; Arab states like Egypt and Jordan on the back foot.  They worry about Islamist parties, such as the Muslim Brotherhood, in their own countries and don&rsquo;t like the idea of a successful role model next door.   At 8pm, as the region&rsquo;s news bulletins start, the leaders emerge to make statements to the press.  The journalists scurry.  Israeli press officers efficiently offer translated and typed transcripts and start a round of interviews.  Palestinian spokesman Saeb Erekat appears and is promptly smothered by about thirty cameramen.   And the outcome of all this?  Not a lot.  The Israelis grabbed the headlines with an offer to release 250 Fatah prisoners.  There are over 10,000 Palestinians in prison in Israel.  Just over half have been convicted of an offence and around 800 are held without charge.</unknownNode><unknownNode> 						Continue reading "In the summit sun" 					</unknownNode><unknownNode>Presented by Jeremy Paxman</unknownNode><unknownNode>EU referendum?

Just how far away is peace between Israel and the Palestinians? And does Tony Blair have a useful role as an envoy in bringing about such peace? The western backed Palestinian President, Mahmoud Abbas, met with the Israeli PM in Egypt today to talk peace. But at the same time Hamas proved they can still have a powerful affect on the process. They released a statement from the Israeli Corporal Gilad Shalit - the first since he was kidnapped exactly a year ago. Mark Urban investigates.</unknownNode><unknownNode>GB tour Finally Paul Mason has spent the last six weeks travelling Britain to find out what people make of politics as Gordon Brown prepares to take over as PM. In his final report he meets the surfers of South Wales to discover whether there is a new wave of support for David Cameron's Conservatives.</unknownNode><unknownNode>This week's revelation that Gordon Brown has been trying to lure Lib Dems into his government came as something of a relief to me personally (though let me stress that I make no comment on whether it's a good or bad thing).  </unknownNode><unknownNode>On the day Gordon Brown launched his campaign at the start of May, Newsnight led the programme with a big story on this.  Brown had spoken that morning of a "Government of all the talents", and I had asked him whether he was "ruling in, or ruling out", the idea of appointing "ministers from other political parties".  He wasn't ruling it in, or ruling it out, Mr Brown replied.  I got quite excited, as Brown's comments seemed to tally with things I had been hearing from Scotland, and comments he'd made on the Andrew Marr programme in early January.  So Newsnight went big on it that night, with an opening headline asking if Brown was about to appoint Liberal Democrats as ministers (watch my report here).  </unknownNode><unknownNode>The story was immediately rubbished, not just in the studio by our own Newsnight political panel (of all the talents), but also live on the programme by the pensions minister James Purnell who suggested we were daft to interpret what Brown had said in this way.  And members of Brown's entourage subsequently made it clear I'd misunderstood - he was merely thinking of non-Labour people - people like Chris Patten and Seb Coe - in advisory roles, chairing commissions and that sort of thing.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>Strange, I thought, what's so new about that?  Don't people like Patten and Coe do those sort of jobs already?  I had an uncomfortable few days, wondering if I'd been guilty of terrible misjudgement - and gross hype - in one of my first stories as political editor.  It was especially worrying that nobody else in the BBC, or the rest of the media, had run with the story.  So you can imagine that I felt a certain amusement last night when I heard young Mr Purnell back on Newsnight explaining to viewers what a jolly good idea it was for Mr Brown to approach Lib Dems, an example of his new non-tribal approach to politics etc. etc.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>And, as I explained on Wednesday night, it now seems that even if there aren't any Lib Dems in Brown's new government next week, we can expect several ministers who aren't Labour Party members, or who may even be members of other political parties.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Mind you, this isn't going down very well in the Parliamentary Labour Party.  Many Labour MPs saw the advent of Brown as their big chance finally to get a government job - feeling they've been unfairly neglected by Tony Blair - whilst existing ministers will be worried about holding on to their jobs.  Even if Brown's administration were confined to Labour Party people, I reckon there would be bound to be a lot of disappointed MPs.  Extending his ministry beyond Labour is bound to encourage the sense of resentment and disgruntlement.    Michael Crick is Newsnight&rsquo;s Politcal Editor &ndash; you can read the recent Telegraph profile of him here.</unknownNode><unknownNode>From Kavita Puri - programme producer.</unknownNode><unknownNode>We have a a special edition of Newsnight tonight.

After consuming a large main course the waiter asked if anyone would like a pudding. Conscious of the time, they all said &lsquo;No&rsquo;, with the exception of Dr Reid who specified that he&rsquo;d like a single ball of vanilla ice-cream. A few minutes later the waiter returned with a bowl containing three balls of ice-cream, and the customary wafer. &ldquo;But I asked for a single ball,&rdquo; the Home Secretary complained. &ldquo;F***ing eat it!&rdquo; the waiter shot back.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>A government of all the talentsReally? Gordon Brown's overtures to Paddy Ashdown to join his government might have flattered but ultimately failed to win the former Lib Dem leader, perhaps more importantly though, they have exacerbated tensions within the Liberal Democrats and provoked disquiet on the Labour back benches. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Is this what he wanted? Rather than showing his commitment to building a government of all the talents, was Gordon Brown up to something altogether more machiavellian when he approached the Lib Dem peer? Paul Mason will be on hand to guide us through the murky political waters. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Ask Gordon Brown Tomorrow in a special programme with Gordon Brown, three of the BBC's specialist editors will cross-examine the in-coming prime minister.

His inspiration was artists such as Malevich, Klee and Mondrian but he went further in his desire to liberate colour into space.

In a dramatic statement to the Scottish Parliament the new SNP First Minister claimed that Tony Blair has done a deal with Colonel Gaddafi that would allow the return of the Lockerbie bomber to Libya and in effect violate the independence of Holyrood.

Even the environmental groups are pleasantly surprised (though not, of course, entirely satisfied.)</unknownNode><unknownNode>From Newsnight's Economics Editor Stephanie Flanders, somewhere near the G8 summit in Heiligendamm.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Today is supposed to be the big day for protests in the temporary police state that is the G8 venue. Thousands of demonstrators will spend the day trying to breach the 12 km perimeter fence around the hotel where the leaders are meeting - and block the roads going in and out. Here's my question - or questions. What, exactly are they demonstrating about? And why don't I know?</unknownNode><unknownNode>I'm not speaking rhetorically here. I'm genuinely confused about what these demonstrators are about, because the mood today seems so different than when these protests really got started, at the WTO meetings in Seattle in 1999. Back then, you had your Black Bloc equivalents and your downright crazies, but most of the protestors were there to protest concrete injustices - the plight of Mozambican cashew farmers, for example - and could recite chapter and verse of which IMF program and/or international trade rule was to blame. Journalists quickly discovered that the activists were often better informed than the delegates. So, even when the demonstrations turned nasty (the infamous "battle of Seattle"), the activists still got a hearing from the likes of President Clinton.  "I disagree with a lot of what they say, but I'm still glad they're here", he told the disgruntled trade ministers besieged in the conference hall.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Hard to imagine Angela Merkel or George Bush saying that today - and not just because they are cut from more conservative cloth than Mr Clinton. Since then the system has changed - and so have the protestors. The "system" has changed by co-opting the demonstrators' agenda to a remarkable extent. For the next WTO meeting the ministers had learned their lesson - they held it in the highly inaccessible city of Doha. But they also co-opted much of the demonstrators' agenda by dedicating the Millennium round of trade talks to developing countries.  There's been a similar change in the agenda of the G8.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Now I'll admit, delivery on that agenda has been mixed, at best. As I explained yesterday, delivery is not the g8's strong suit.  (And it's been non-existent in the case of the Doha trade round - though how much that round could really have achieved for developing countries is a subject I'll leave to another day). But you can't say that the issues of poverty, unfair trade rules, or climate change aren't being discussed. That's pretty much all that is discussed at these meetings. And many of the people who used to be on the streets protesting are now working for NGOs who lobby and engage with the G8 governments and the IMF and the World Bank on an almost daily basis.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Are the protestors here to complain about delivery on aid promises? Some are, for sure: Oxfam has had some nice theatrics here, as usual. Greenpeace have put to sea here to call for more on climate change. I like to think a few want to prevent the meetings to protest the waste of taxpayers' money. But the fence-chargers? I am at a loss. When I look at the protestors crossing the fields here or blocking the roads, I don't see any signs about aid, or debt, or evil multi-national corporations. Nor are there any t shirts saying "value for money for G8 taxpayers" (I would have bought one). Maybe we journalists should spend a little less time feverishly reporting the twists and turns of the Battle of the Fence, and a little more asking the protagonists why they're here.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>Newsnight received the following email from a serving British Army captain with experience in various theatres including Iraq. We know his identity but have withheld it at his request. Watch Mark Urban's report on morale among soldiers serving in Iraq here.</unknownNode><unknownNode>"I am a serving British Army officer with operational experience in a number of theatres. I am concerned regarding the effect of your recent reports from Baghdad (Watch Mark&rsquo;s report here). I have been forwarded the correspondence between yourself and David Edwards of medialens.org, and would like to highlight that it is not merely medialens users, who are concerned about embedded coverage with the US Army. The intentions and continuing effects of the US-led invasion and subsequent occupation of Iraq have been questioned by too few people in the mainstream media and political parties, primarily only the Guardian and Independent, and the Liberal Democrats, respectively.</unknownNode><unknownNode>There is a widespread, and well-sourced, belief based on both experience and evidence, in both the British military and academia, that the US is not "just in Iraq to keep the peace, regardless of what the troops on the ground believe. It is in Iraq to establish a client state amenable to the requirements of US realpolitik in a key, oil-rich region. To doubt this is to be ignorant of the motives that have guided US foreign policy in the post-war period and a mountain of evidence since 2003." (quote from medialens)</unknownNode><unknownNode>That the invasion was 'illegal, immoral and unwinnable', and the 'greatest foreign policy blunder since Suez' - to paraphrase the Liberal Democrats - is the overwhelming feeling of many of my peers, and they speak of loathsome six-month tours, during which they led patrols with dread and fear, reluctantly providing target practice for insurgents, senselessly haemorrhaging casualties, and squandering soldiers' lives, as part of Bush's vain attempt to delay the inevitable Anglo-US rout until after the next US election. Given a free choice most of us would never have invaded Iraq, and certainly would have withdrawn long ago. Hopefully, Tony Blairs's handover to Gordon Brown will herald a change of policy, and rapid withdrawal, but skewed pro-US coverage inhibits proper public debate, and is deeply unhealthy; lethally-so to many of us deployed to Iraq. </unknownNode><unknownNode>The [inadvertent] dangers of bias of embedded journalism are well known and there is a risk that the 'official line' can be conflated with evidence and facts. Jon Snow graphically demonstrated the effect of this during the initial invasion of Iraq in his programme The True Face of War. I am conscious that reporting independently, outside of the 'green zone' in Iraq is nigh on impossible, but I would merely request that the 'official line/White House propaganda' be handled with an appropriate degree of scepticism, and be caveated accordingly."</unknownNode><unknownNode>From Newsnight's Economics Editor Stephanie Flanders at the G8 Summit. Watch her report here.</unknownNode><unknownNode>They say G8 summits are about the numbers. And this one is no exception. We've got 16,000 police, 11,000 soldiers, two minesweepers, a dozen AWAC planes and I don't know how many helicopters - all dedicated to protect the leaders of the seven largest rich countries in the world (plus Russia). If you watch my report you'll see my heroic efforts to get as close as possible to where the action is. Which is not very close at all.</unknownNode><unknownNode>It's all a long way from 1974, when the US invited a handful of finance officials for a chat in the White House library. That "library group" was the precursor to the G8. And I have a strong suspicion that they got more things done.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Of course that's not the official line.  The official line is that you can get more business done with 8 leaders sitting in a room for a few hours than you can in months of lower level diplo-chat. But that's only half-right. It's true that the prospect of having such a meeting - and the world and his dog waiting outside to hear the results - means that any leader with voters to worry about will call a meeting of his staff about 3 months before aforesaid meeting to ask them what the "deliverables" are going to be. Then the staff - in the case of the G8, the worthy Sherpahs, devote several months of diplo-chat to finding stuff for their bosses to announce (the deliverables).</unknownNode><unknownNode>This system can work fairly well - with the right leaders and the right issue. The right leaders means people who are either very dedicated to a given cause, or need to get re-elected quite soon, or both. And the right issue is one where either the G8 can deliver on their promises immediately - or give the task to someone else. Because the G8 is an institution that's designed to produce deliverables. It's not designed to actually deliver. Consider what happened two years ago. Say what you like about Gleneagles (and who doesn't?) they DID deliver on most of their promises to write down African country debt. Why? Because it was the IMF and the World Bank that actually had to do it.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Where the promises involved individual governments translating their promises into aid budgets, year after year - they weren't kept. Or many of them weren't kept. The G8 research group at the University of Toronto reckons that governments have stuck by only  65% of the commitments at Gleneagles. Perhaps Chancellor Merkel should look on the bright side - if she doesn't get any big new commitments from the heads at this year's summit, there will be fewer promises leftover for leaders not to keep.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>Join the 'How gr8 is the G8' debate here.</unknownNode><unknownNode>From tonight's presenter, Gavin Esler:</unknownNode><unknownNode>Military morale Our diplomatic editor, Mark Urban, has been hearing from serving British soldiers about low morale in Iraq and loss of support from some in the army for the mission there.

Don&rsquo;t miss it. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Let me come clean:  I love flying and I have done ever since I was a boy.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Indeed, I still remember the day a friend of mine brought an impossibly exotic treasure into our primary school classroom.  It was one of those plastic packets of miniature &ldquo;travel essentials&rdquo; from some now defunct airline &ndash; Pan American or BOAC.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>I can&rsquo;t remember exactly what it contained &ndash; nylon socks, an eye-shade and a perfumed face wipe in a foil wrap perhaps.  That wasn&rsquo;t the point.  What made my friend&rsquo;s little plastic package so fabulous was that it was proof that my friend had actually flown in a plane.</unknownNode><unknownNode>It was three years before I flew for the first time &ndash; a family holiday to Morocco when I was about 10.  Of course I&rsquo;ve flown hundreds of times since then &ndash; most recently on my Mission to Mumbai &ndash; but I still enjoy every flight.</unknownNode><unknownNode>My problem is that a year of carbon-counting as Ethical Man brought home just what an environmental disaster flying is &ndash; my family&rsquo;s one trip to the Canaries last year created as much carbon as a year of driving our car.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve posed my deliberately provocative question.  I want to know if it is possible to fly with a clear conscience.    So here&rsquo;s the good news: when you look at the numbers, modern jet aeroplanes are actually a very efficient form of transport.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>Indeed, the jet engine is one of the most effective ways to convert the energy from fuel into thrust.  The best jets are 37 per cent efficient.  By contrast it seems modern petrol engines are around 25 per cent efficient while a finely tuned diesel will achieve, at best, 32 per cent efficiency.</unknownNode><unknownNode>How does that translate into actual fuel consumption?  Take a look at some figures: my old car - a two litre petrol Saab 9-5 estate - uses 8.6 litres per 100km.  The most efficient cars do better than that.  The Toyota Prius, for example, is much more frugal.  It uses 4.3 l/100km.</unknownNode><unknownNode>So what about aircraft?  The average jet plane now uses around 4.8 l/100 km per passenger &ndash; just a little worse than a Prius with no passengers.  But the manufacturers say that modern jets are much more efficient.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>Airbus claims it makes the most efficient aeroplane currently flying, the A380.  It says this behemoth uses just 2.9 l/ 100km per passenger.  (Here&rsquo;s the dull bit: that&rsquo;s the fuel consumption when you assume a three class configuration operating at capacity with 525 passengers).  </unknownNode><unknownNode>As far as I can tell the latest jumbos are similarly efficient &ndash; it is hard to be certain because the manufacturers do not publish comparable figures &ndash; but Boeing&rsquo;s 747-8 uses 3.7 l/100kms per passenger when operating at 70 per cent of capacity.  (Assuming it is configured to hold 470 passengers in three classes).</unknownNode><unknownNode>So if jet engines are more efficient than car engines why do they get such a bad rap?  </unknownNode><unknownNode>One reason is pretty obvious - we use planes to travel extremely long distances.  I covered 14,000 kilometres on my trip to Mumbai and that weekend in Jamaica racked up just over 15,000 kms.  Each trip covered pretty much the same distance as the average British car driver travels in a year.</unknownNode><unknownNode>The other big problem is that planes release their pollutants high up in the atmosphere where they have an even stronger greenhouse effect.  The process is known as radiative forcing.  What radiative forcing means is that aircraft emissions are reckoned to be almost twice as damaging as emissions at ground level.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>So, combine the distance you fly with the effect of radiative forcing you can see why environmentally conscious people get so worried by our appetite for air travel.  You can do as I did - get rid of your car, switch to energy efficient bulbs, eat locally grown food - but take one holiday flight and you will wipe out all your careful carbon cuts.</unknownNode><unknownNode>So here&rsquo;s the important question: is there anything that can make flying less environmentally damaging?  The received wisdom is that there is no simple fix but I&rsquo;m not so sure.  Here are some thoughts &ndash; please tell me what you think.</unknownNode><unknownNode>My friend Omar - who featured in our original flying film &ndash; speculates that turboprop planes &ndash; a kind of hybrid between a propeller and a jet plane could be as much as a third more efficient on short journeys.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>That huge saving isn&rsquo;t because turboprops are inherently more efficient than jets.  The reason is that much of the fuel used by jets on short journeys is to get them to the high altitudes where they are most efficient.  Turboprops fly at lower altitudes which saves fuel and also reduces radiative forcing.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>What I want to know is this:  if Omar is right why don&rsquo;t more airlines use turboprops? </unknownNode><unknownNode>And Omar reckons turboprops would be less efficient than jets on long-haul flights.  But there is some good news here too.  The aeroplane manufacturers say they are doing their very best to improve fuel efficiency.  They say today&rsquo;s aircraft are 70 per cent more efficient than those of 40 years ago and that more efficient planes are in development.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>Boeing boasts that its new 787 will better the fuel efficiency of even the A380.  It claims that fuel consumption (assuming a two class configuration and 90 per cent occupancy) could be as low as 2.4 litres per 100 km.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>There are other ways to cut emissions.  IATA, the International Air Transport Association, estimates that improving air traffic control could cut emissions by as much as 12 per cent.  It claims that by straightening out air lanes it has already cut millions of tonnes of CO2.</unknownNode><unknownNode>And I&rsquo;ve got a last suggestion that would massively increase aircraft efficiency in a stroke.  It would be straightforward and cheap to implement and doesn&rsquo;t rely on some untested new technology.</unknownNode><unknownNode>What is my innovation?  Just get rid of first and business class.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>Think about it.  If you packed the A380 with economy seats it could hold 853 passengers.  A back of the envelope calculation suggests this &ldquo;economy&rdquo; Airbus (operating at capacity) would use 1.9 litres per passenger per 100km.  That&rsquo;s pretty much half the fuel consumption of most current aircraft.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Of course flying in such an aircraft would still be a carbon intensive activity but considerably less so than current planes.  That&rsquo;s because the effect of radiative forcing means each tonne of carbon you don&rsquo;t emit is the environmental equivalent of saving two tonnes.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>In fact &ndash; here&rsquo;s a thought &ndash; now that I&rsquo;m not Ethical Man maybe that&rsquo;s what I should do.   An economy-only eco-airline, the green alternative!  </unknownNode><unknownNode>What&rsquo;s the telephone number of Airbus again? </unknownNode><unknownNode> From Kirsty Wark.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Newsnight Review decamped to the Cannes Film Festival and tonight John Harris, Mark Kermode, Julie Myerson and I will have our distilled thoughts on the films we&rsquo;ve seen.</unknownNode><unknownNode>I can tell from the panel&rsquo;s body language when we emerge blinking into the light from screenings that there&rsquo;s going to be some major disagreements on the show.</unknownNode><unknownNode>The deal on Newsnight Review is that the guests are not allowed to confer on films before the show &ndash; it&rsquo;s been tough because we&rsquo;ve all had such strong reactions to what we&rsquo;ve seen. I know that because John, Mark and Julie can talk to me individually and I keep schtum about their views.    It has been such an extraordinary festival and before I tell you what we&rsquo;ve all seen, we&rsquo;ve also bagged the only British interview with Martin Scorsese, who has just launched the World Cinema Foundation here in Cannes to save neglected, damaged and "orphan" films from all over the world.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Scorsese has put together a committee of some of the best directors including Wong Kar Wai, Walter Salles and Bernard Tavernier and their aim is to encourage old archives to come forth with material for a new and eager audience.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Scorsese talked about films leading to a better cultural understanding between nations and it struck me that his outfit is a bit like a United Nations of cinema. </unknownNode><unknownNode>But where are these films going to be shown? The multiplexes? Are they going to put a Kenyan or a French film from the 1960s on their screens? But it&rsquo;s not just neglected films &ndash; what about Scorsese&rsquo;s own films? It&rsquo;s such a pity that my kids will never see Taxi Driver or Raging Bull on anything but a DVD. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be great if a multiplex had a Scorsese day or a Wim Wenders day or a Kurosawa day? Fat chance.</unknownNode><unknownNode>He also talks to me of his upcoming documentary on the Rolling Stones, his new project with Mick Jagger, and sex on screen.   Among the films we&rsquo;ve seen, Persepolis &ndash; up for the Palme D&rsquo;Or &ndash; falls into the category of aiding cultural understanding with great wit and warmth. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Iranian director Marjane Satrapi has turned her autobiographical graphic novel into a feature length cartoon about growing up during the Islamic Revolution with her co-director Vincent Paronnaud.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Also in the running is Quentin Tarantino&rsquo;s homage to 70s Grindhouse films &ndash; Deathproof - originally designed as a companion piece to Robert Rodriguez&rsquo;s Planet Terror.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Deathproof is a slasher movie with Kurt Russell as the psycho Stuntman Mike &ndash; out to murder a posse of beautiful women. It has all the hallmarks of the B-movies of the seventies which Tarantino fed on when he was growing up - seemingly random jump cuts, refocusing, scratches, rough joins all perfectly composed by Tarantino.    In the competition, by contrast, Julian Schnabel&rsquo;s film, The Diving Bell and the Butterfly - Le Scaphandre et Le Papillon &ndash; is an exercise in restraint, beauty, wit and honesty.</unknownNode><unknownNode>It&rsquo;s based on the autobiographical novel by the former chief editor of French Elle who suffered a massive stroke when he was 43. It left him totally paralysed but alert, able to use only one eye to communicate.</unknownNode><unknownNode>And so Jean-Dominique Bauby, this once fast-living, charismatic seducer told his story by the blink of an eye and Julian Schnabel has in his film made the audience Jean-Do&rsquo;s confidante locked in from the world around him.    It&rsquo;s a privilege to see films here in Cannes. So few complain about queuing in 30 degrees for up to an hour to secure a seat at a screening. Once in a cool dark cinema you are taken to some strange places. One such place is the Scottish highlands as imagined in Harmony Korine&rsquo;s film Mr Lonely. The cast are all impersonators living in a commune. Samantha Morton is Marilyn Monroe and Anita Pallenberg is the Queen. The Mr Lonely of the title is Michael Jackson played by Diego Luna. But Korine also pursues a parallel seemingly unconnected story about flying nuns in South America, a phenomenon which is regarded as a miracle by their local priest, played by Werner Herzog. Mr Lonely is in competition for Un Certain Regard.    Not in competition at all is Michael Winterbottom&rsquo;s A Mighty Heart. And in fact there are no British films up for the Palme D&rsquo;Or at all this year. The film is based on the book of the same name by Mariane Pearl about her husband Daniel&rsquo;s abduction and murder in Pakistan in January 2002.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Pearl, the Asia Bureau chief of the Wall Street Journal, was pursuing a lead on the failed shoe bomber Richard Reid when he was kidnapped by jihadists &ndash; among the first of many journalists captured post 9/11 during the war on terror. Dan Futterman plays Daniel Pearl and Mariane Pearl is played by Angelina Jolie.</unknownNode><unknownNode>We&rsquo;ll also be discussing Gus Van Sant&rsquo;s skater boy nightmare Paranoid Park. It&rsquo;s based on Blake Nelson&rsquo;s novel about teenage disaffection in Portland, Oregon and it&rsquo;s classic Van Sant territory.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Death also stalks Bela Tarr&rsquo;s film of the Georges Simenon novel The Man from London. It&rsquo;s a mesmeric black and white film about mortality, sin and punishment and the often unrealisable longing for happiness.</unknownNode><unknownNode>The Coen brothers are also in the running for the Palme D&rsquo;Or with their adaptation of Cormac McCarthy&rsquo;s novel No Country for Old Men, set on the frontier between Texas and Mexico, starring Tommy Lee Jones and Javier Bardem.    Our Newsnight Review guests have also been to see Control, Anton Corbijn&rsquo;s film about the death of the Joy Division&rsquo;s frontman, Ian Curtis, which also features Michael Winterbottom&rsquo;s 24 Hour Party People.</unknownNode><unknownNode>So it is going to be a packed programme. John, Mark and Julie will also reveal which film they loved the most and the one that they loathed.</unknownNode><unknownNode>We&rsquo;re broadcasting from the UK Film Council's beachside pavilion and as it&rsquo;s outside we&rsquo;ve been watching the forecast as intently as we&rsquo;ve been watching the films. There is a threat of thunder and lightning but if it doesn&rsquo;t materialise we hope they&rsquo;ll be plenty of sparks on the programme anyway.

In his 1997 budget speech Mr Brown said, "I will not allow house prices to get out of control". Ten years on and they have spiralled leaving tens of thousands of people unable to get onto the first rung of the property ladder. </unknownNode><unknownNode>So - do we need a housing crash?

Razia Iqbal reports for Newsnight from Cannes.</unknownNode><unknownNode>In his 1997 budget speech Gordon Brown said, "I will not allow house prices to get out of control". Ten years on and they have spiralled leaving thousands of people unable get onto the first rung of the property ladder.</unknownNode><unknownNode>So do we now need a crash in the housing market to level the playing field once more? Are crazy house prices creating a new generation of renters unable to buy? Send us your experiences - have you been priced out of the market? Or have you done well out of the boom and long may it continue?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Let us know below and we'll discuss the issues and put some of your points to the government and a select panel on tonight's Newsnight.</unknownNode><unknownNode>From Gavin Esler, Newsnight presenter.</unknownNode><unknownNode>The CongoWe have a powerful film from Fergal Keane about the failure of the UN in the Congo. The peacekeeping mission has been powerless to act while a warlord has committed gross human rights abuses and forced tens of thousands of Congolese to leave their homes. We track down the warlord and speak to the UN about their inability to intervene.   EnergyWe now have the latest energy white paper. This one argues the case for nuclear power. Does the government really intend to "consult" over the next five months or has it already made up its mind?  Michael Crick is on the case, and I'll speaking to the Minister in charge.    McJobsThe fast food chain McDonalds has struggled hard to change its image. No longer as secretive as it once was, McDonalds UK has launched a campaign to change the Oxford English Dictionary definition of the word "McJob". </unknownNode><unknownNode>"An unstimulating low-paid job with few prospects, especially one created by the expansion of the service sector".</unknownNode><unknownNode>Newsnight has been granted access to McDonalds to talk to staff about how they view their work - and what they think of the "McJob" label, and I've been talking to the company boss in the UK, Steve Easterbrook. You can see the full length interview here, and join the "McJob" debate here. </unknownNode><unknownNode>"An unstimulating low-paid job with few prospects, especially one created by the expansion of the service sector".</unknownNode><unknownNode> That's how the Oxford English dictionary defines "McJob". McDonalds disagrees, and they have organised a petition to change the definition. MPs have joined in too today. Some have signed an early day motion saying that "McJob" is a derogatory term damaging to the people who work for the company. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Are they right? Have you worked in McDonalds - what is your experience? Or have you worked in another service sector and think McDonalds is a trailblazer as a good employer. Is this all part of a PR makeover for McDonalds? It started with healthy food and now it's about rebranding themselves as an exemplary employer.

This seems unlikely. Russia says it cannot agree to the extradition.</unknownNode><unknownNode>So what will this do to the already strained diplomatic relations between the UK and Russia?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Susan Watts, one of the first reporters to link the Polonium trail to Andrei Lugovoi, has been looking at the evidence.</unknownNode><unknownNode>And Mark Urban will be exploring the diplomatic implications.</unknownNode><unknownNode>JUSTICE</unknownNode><unknownNode>The head of the judiciary, Lord Phillips, has struck out against the newly created Ministry of Justice, calling it a "serious constitutional problem".</unknownNode><unknownNode>Lord Phillips told the Constitutional Affairs Select Committee that negotiations between the judges and the government to put in constitutional safeguards had not resulted in agreement.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Are the judges now set on an unavoidable collision course with the government? Michael Crick is on the case. </unknownNode><unknownNode>HIPs</unknownNode><unknownNode>With less than two weeks to go until they were due to be made compulsory for anyone selling a home, the government has announced that Home Information Packs will be delayed until August, and then only phased in.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Why has the government been so slow to react to the problems?</unknownNode><unknownNode>ETHICAL MAN GOES GLOBAL</unknownNode><unknownNode>In a temporary reincarnation, Newsnight's one-time Ethical Man, Justin Rowlatt, travels (somewhat unethically by plane) to India - the fourth biggest producer of greenhouse gases on earth.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Can he persuade middle class families enjoying new found wealth there to consider giving up their recently acquired cars and reduce their CO2 emissions? </unknownNode><unknownNode>From Simon Enright, programme producer.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Medical MoraleWhy is it that doctors are paid more than ever and work fewer hours but according to James Johnson who's just been forced to resign as boss of the BMA, morale has never been lower?

Is this institutional racism? Not according to the latest evidence from the Institute of Psychiatry and they argue that calling it racism is getting in the way of treating Black Afro-Caribbean patients.

Altaf Hussain is the leader of the Muttahida Quami Movement - MQM. He directs his flock via phone - when he talks thousands gather round in Pakistan to listen to him on loudspeaker.</unknownNode><unknownNode>But his critics - amongst them cricket legend turned opposition politician Imran Khan - say he shouldn't even be here. He accuses the British Government of giving sanctuary to a man whose party he alleges was linked to recent violence in Pakistan. Tonight we'll look at the Edgware operation, and speak to Imran Khan in Islamabad. </unknownNode><unknownNode>GB tourYesterday a softer, humbler sounding Prime Minister elect said he wanted to win back trust for the Labour Party and listen to the country. So we take to the road for the GB tour to see what he really means and indeed what the country's saying. </unknownNode><unknownNode>We kick off in Basildon, a bell weather constituency which was Tory under Thatcher and Labour under Blair. What do they make of Gordon? </unknownNode><unknownNode>Good day for burying awkward news?MPs have just passed a controversial bill to exempt themselves and peers from freedom of information laws. What does this mean in practice? It means all of us - voters, media, the public at large, will have a much harder time finding out the truth from them. Just how does this fit into Gordon Brown's new attempt to build trust?</unknownNode><unknownNode>WembleyWe've almost forgotten how many years late it is but tomorrow the stadium will officially open.

And who, exactly, is in charge as we speak? As Gordon Brown formally sees off his challengers to become Prime Minister Elect for the next six weeks, Tony Blair has started the long goodbye in Washington - a place where he often joked he was more warmly received than at home.  So if a critical decision has to be made over the next 6 weeks, who does the cabinet listen to? </unknownNode><unknownNode>At Newsnight, we've risen to the challenge and appointed one political correspondent to each PM, each side of the pond. Gordon Brown says his conversation with the country is just beginning, but how will he cope with arguably the most controversial relationship of them all - his dealings with George Bush over Iraq? Michael Crick and David Grossman will give their assessments.</unknownNode><unknownNode>GazaAs I write, the troubles in Gaza are increasing. We've had a report of an Israeli air strike and Hamas has threatened to retaliate with suicide attacks. We'll give you the latest on the fighting there, as tensions between Hamas, Fatah and the Israelis heighten.   </unknownNode><unknownNode>The Iraqi GovernmentAnd in our final film in this week's series of exclusive reports from inside Iraq, Mark Urban turns his attention to an assessment of the effectiveness of the Iraqi Government. </unknownNode><unknownNode>It is crucial to the viability of a future state without the coalition forces, but its record is distinctly patchy. Corruption is a serious problem, and it seems they've significantly underspent the money allocated to them to reconstruct their own country.

And you can visit our Iraq in-depth site here.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Grammar SchoolsThis is shaping up to be the first really serious internal policy row for David Cameron with his own party. It appears to be a conflict between the cherished Tory belief in meritocracy (in favour of bright children going to grammar schools) and the contrary view from Shadow Education Secretary David Willetts that "academic selection entrenches advantage, it does not spread it."   The CoronationAt the time of writing it could be that Gordon Brown will not face any challenger for the Labour leadership. We'll assess the impact of the coronation - if that's what it is - and have the result of a special Newsnight poll at the hustings for the race to be deputy leader.   A very special special relationshipDavid Grossman is in the United States assessing the extraordinary relationship between Blair and Bush - and trying to figure out where Gordon Brown might fit in with the Bush administration. (Personally, I doubt Mr Bush will ever yell out: "Yo! Brown.")</unknownNode><unknownNode>From Gavin Esler, Newsnight Presenter.</unknownNode><unknownNode>It is amazing how the plight of one little girl, in Portugal, captures the imagination of so many of us.

It is so difficult to obtain any real access to what is happening on the streets of Baghdad, but tonight we have. </unknownNode><unknownNode>It's a stunning and brave piece of journalism, and along with Mark Urban's report last night, it paints a grim picture of the terrible conditions in Iraq.   Plus: I've just been talking to Bono and Bob Geldof about the shortcomings of the deal reached at Gleneagles almost two years ago to do something for the poorest people in the world. </unknownNode><unknownNode>The G8 - according to a report on progress towards meeting the goals agreed to at Gleneagles - is falling short. Bob and Bono praise Britain and Japan,  but  point the finger at Germany, Italy and France. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Bono  frankly admits there may be a crisis about their own credibility in endorsing the G8 agreement since so many countries have not lived up to what they promised.

I will respond to each one individually when I get the chance but I've been very touched by the enormous response, especially from those people who have had similar experiences in their own lives or with their own families. Charlotte has been very moved by the response too and - as she said last night - her prognosis is now very good. She is much better. Thank you all. </unknownNode><unknownNode>From Kirsty Wark, Newsnight Presenter.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Tonight we have two extraordinary films on Newsnight. We devote much of the programme to the first of a series of reports from Mark Urban in Iraq, in which we see at first hand the US troop surge in action and gauge its impact.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>Mark spent 72 hours embedded with US forces in Al Doura - a Sunni dominated area in the south of Baghdad. </unknownNode><unknownNode>He's given us a fascinating insight into the everyday dangers faced by Iraqis, and the pressures on US soldiers as they try bring security to the area, as they round up what seems like a never ending stream of insurgents, and at the same time try to win hearts and minds.</unknownNode><unknownNode>And today's confirmation by the US army  that three of their soldiers have been kidnapped in Baghdad - seemingly by Al Qaeda - is just the latest indication of what they are up against. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Also tonight to mark the start of BBC cancer care week, Charlotte Esler, the fourteen year old daughter of my Newsnight colleague Gavin has made a film about her own cancer story. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Charlotte was diagnosed with Hodgkin's Lymphoma in November, and after treatment her cancer is now in remission. </unknownNode><unknownNode>She explains the impact it had on her and the family, and interviews another person who was diagnosed with lymphoma - Sir Menzies Campbell.</unknownNode><unknownNode>And Michael Crick will be with me for the latest on potential challengers to Gordon Brown, and the competition to become deputy leader.</unknownNode><unknownNode>And looking ahead to tomorrow, we'll be launching a key element of our coverage of the Prime Ministerial succession: The Order of the Brown Nose.

Might there be a signal that he is planning a revolutionary move? </unknownNode><unknownNode>And how would Gordon Brown signal a change of direction while sticking to the New Labour path?  </unknownNode><unknownNode>We look at his biggest challenges at home and abroad.  The Chancellor says he wants to lead a government "humble enough to know its place" </unknownNode><unknownNode>But is the Chancellor himself humble enough? Newsnight's specially commissioned poll suggests not.   </unknownNode><unknownNode>He is seen as more arrogant and less in touch with voters than Tony Blair and David Cameron, scoring 30% to the  prime minister's 34% and David  Cameron's 40% of the vote. </unknownNode><unknownNode>When the 1,001 people polled were asked whther he was trustworthy, less than a third  replied yes for Gordon Brown, who is on 31%, compared with 38% for the Tory leader and 41% for the Liberal Democrat leader.

Yet the architect of this makeover, John Reid, has announced he's leaving before the job is done. Will the Home Office ever be "fit for purpose"? In a special programme, we examine the key issues facing an incoming Home Secretary and new Prime Minister.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Security  Will the newly restructured Home Office, with its greater focus on counter-terrorism, ensure that the mistakes made leading up to the 7 July bomb attacks never happen again? With four people arrested today in connection with the London bombings we have been in Beeston. The man who warned West Yorkshire police about Mohammed Sidique Khan two years before the attacks tells us that the police failed to respond to his warnings. Could they have intervened earlier and prevented the bombings?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Prisons and the judiciary The challenges facing the newly formed Justice ministry are just as pressing. The prison population is rapidly approaching capacity and some senior judges have severe reservations about bringing prisons and courts into the same department. Today, Lord Falconer has unveiled his blueprint for his ministry - but will it work? </unknownNode><unknownNode>Asylum  Can the asylum system ever give protection to those who need it while preventing the thousands who seek to abuse it from doing so?

On our special hour long edition of Newsnight we'll have the very latest results and analysis of how it all changes the way we'll be governed, and the impact the results will have on Gordon Brown's grand plans for leadership.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Michael Crick will be in the studio with me, along with senior key figures from each of the parties.  The biggest upset of the night may yet be the scandal over the way the vote in Scotland was conducted - both the estimated 100,000 ballot papers spoiled by people confused about the voting system and the computer failure which has held up the vote and may have rejected ballot papers.  An official Inquiry has just been announced.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>Gavin will be live from Edinburgh where any one of the possible final results is going to cause fireworks, after Labour's worst result in half a century. The prospect of Prime Minister Brown and First Minister Salmond, is one which the former abhors and the latter relishes. In Wales, Labour may be forced into coalition. </unknownNode><unknownNode>In England, the results that affect the majority of the UK, the complexion of many councils has changed as Labour has lost one after another.  Tony Blair says the results are a "springboard" for a Labour victory in the next general election, but could the Conservative&rsquo;s showing at the local elections be enough to catapult Cameron towards Downing Street - or is this as good as it gets for him?  And what about The Liberal Democrats - to continue the momentum analogies - is Menzies Campbell on the Big Dipper after last night's dramatic plunge in the polls? </unknownNode><unknownNode>We'll be asking whether the Iraq war was the main reason Labour took such a drubbing, and speaking to the man who wants to challenge Gordon Brown for Number 10, Michael Meacher.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>Tonight's the night for reconvening our wise and witty panel - Danny Finkelstein, Peter Hyman, and Olly Grender - to give the whole thing a bit of a spin.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Review is resting but will be back with a bang next Friday.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Please leave your thoughts below...</unknownNode><unknownNode>It's been called "Super" Thursday - with voting in England, Wales and Scotland - so tonight we devote the programme to an extended UK election special.</unknownNode><unknownNode>David Grossman is travelling from north Wales to the central belt of Scotland via the north west of England to gauge reaction from voters.

We can't find jobs, there is nothing to do for fun and even going to college is difficult.</unknownNode><unknownNode>I was hoping things would get better after the war. And in the begining they did: we saw things in Iraq which we have not seen before like satellite television and mobile phones. It was a good period but it didn't last for more than a couple of months. Then the explosions, the killings and the kidnappings began. </unknownNode><unknownNode>I never thought it would get this bad. Who would have thought that we would have curfews at six in the afternoon and all shops closing at 5pm? Shops used to stay open until 10pm at night in Baghdad.</unknownNode><unknownNode>About a year ago I had a conversation with a friend about the situation and our future. He told me that maybe by the time I graduate many local and foreign businesses would open in Iraq and we would have lots of job opportunities.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Unfortunately what I see today is that the few businesses which did start up after the war are closing down. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Most of my friends who graduated can't find any work and many have left the country. Those who are working here are in professions which have nothing to do with their university degrees. </unknownNode><unknownNode>I would be lucky to find work at a private business because they pay better than the government does but then again working in government buildings is safer because they have better security.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>Wherever I find a job it has to be well paid because the cost of living has gone up so much, with every salary increase everything around us gets more expensive.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Nothing I see on the news shocks me anymore. I have seen worse on the streets with my own eyes, there is so much violence and not all of it gets mentioned in the news. </unknownNode><unknownNode>I don't really see any difference in the situation since the start of the new security plan. There are more checkpoints and more house-to-house searches but the explosions are the same and so is the kidnapping and the killing. Nothing different.</unknownNode><unknownNode>I find it very difficult to talk of my future in Iraq. Who knows where the next car bomb might go off? If I do stay alive until I get my degree the first thing I want to do is leave. I don't have any hope that the situation in my country is going to get better.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Cash for honours.

Eliot's most elusive of characters. Lord Turnbull did it in a much publicised interview with the Financial Times recently, off the back of which the Guardian reprinted the whole poem. This week it was David Aaronovitch in The Times.</unknownNode><unknownNode>But way back in October last year when there was talk of political subterfuge, efforts to oust Tony Blair and a mass resignation of junior members of government which forced the prime minister to make clear - or clearer - his timetable for leaving office, Newsnight noted the chancellor's absence and made the comparison with Macavity. We even got the actor Bill Paterson to recite a little for us.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Now, we're not ones for saying "pah, we did it first"... we just thought you might all like to enjoy Mr Paterson's mellifluous tones once again. Watch him here.</unknownNode><unknownNode>In the course of my year of living ethically I&rsquo;ve tried hard to reduce my family&rsquo;s impact on the environment yet quite a few readers of this blog and viewers of Ethical Man have written in to claim that my family is responsible for something which will out-weigh all my family&rsquo;s eco-efforts.  She&rsquo;s called Elsa and very lovely she is too.</unknownNode><unknownNode>You don&rsquo;t need to be John Nash to do the maths. We managed to cut the family&rsquo;s carbon footprint by twenty per cent in the last year &ndash; that&rsquo;s about two tons of carbon.  But Elsa adds a fifth person to the family.  When she&rsquo;s grown up she &ndash; like the rest of us Britons &ndash; is likely to burn off some three tons of carbon a year.  On that basis we are worse off than when we started.</unknownNode><unknownNode>So what I want to know is whether it is ethical to have had little Elsa at all.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>The new orthodoxy seems to be that, when it comes to the environment, people are the problem and it is not hard to see why. Baby Elsa, our third child, is one of about 137 million people born last year.  Unfortunately only 56 million people died leaving an 81 million surplus.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>In short, there&rsquo;s a population explosion underway.  The UN expects the global population to reach 6.7bn by July this year.  That&rsquo;s almost twice what it was when I was born in the mid-sixties and the boom is set to continue.  By the time Elsa is my age the UN reckons another two and a half billion people will be sharing the earth with her.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Many people believe that will lead to global catastrophe:  &ldquo;Without policies to reduce world population, efforts to save our environment cannot succeed,&rdquo; says the Optimum Population Trust (OPT).   </unknownNode><unknownNode> 						Continue reading "How ethical is my baby?" 					</unknownNode><unknownNode> Will David Miliband challenge Gordon Brown for the leadership of the Labour Party?

It is harder to quantify the number of Iraqi deaths, estimates range from 60,000 to more than 600,000. One thing is certain, the cost in human life of the conflict has been huge. And the killing goes on.   But given this was not a snap conflict and had been planned for months, some say years, how did things go so wrong? To find out our diplomatic editor Mark Urban spoke to some of the senior US military figures who were charged with putting Iraq back together after the invasion. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Mark has agreed to answer any questions you might have about US strategy in Iraq raised by his report.

The US administration is finally out of denial when the plight of about 4 million Iraqi refugees, displaced internally and abroad, is mentioned.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Although this has been going on since the start of the war we only recently learnt that &ldquo;the international community had been overwhelmed by the problem, and needed to do much more to help&rdquo;. Dear readers; behold the power of Magical Thinking (and maybe some political arm twisting), it can make millions of people vamoose only to suddenly reappear all over the place looking for refuge. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Before you panic and shout &ldquo;close the gates, the Iraqis are coming!&rdquo; you should know that half of those displaced are still within Iraq&rsquo;s borders and the rest have only made it to neighbouring Arab countries. </unknownNode><unknownNode> 						Continue reading "Magical thinking and the lost country" 					</unknownNode><unknownNode>For Newsnight's Window on Iraq - a series of audio, video and text blogs as part of our in-depth Iraq coverage - Mayada, a Baghdad GP, explains how doctors are finding it increasingly difficult to deliver healthcare.</unknownNode><unknownNode>I am a GP at a health centre in one of Baghdad&rsquo;s poorer districts. It is not an area you would choose to work in but I hold on to my position for two reasons.

Join the debate below.</unknownNode><unknownNode>To coincide with the BBC's week-long examination of the situation in Iraq four years after the US-led invasion, Newsnight has invited critics of the BBC's coverage of the conflict and its aftermath to set out their arguments. Here, Media Lens, an online group that monitors mainstream media output, argues that BBC reporting too often follows the establishment lines. We're keen to debate the issue so read the piece and post your views and comments below.</unknownNode><unknownNode>The Bias In BBC 'Balance'</unknownNode><unknownNode>The BBC's claim that it provides balanced news reporting does not stand up to scrutiny.</unknownNode><unknownNode>As Baghdad fell to US tanks on April 9, 2003, Andrew Marr, then the BBC's political editor, hailed the invasion as a great triumph. Of Tony Blair, Marr declared: "tonight he stands as a larger man and a stronger prime minister as a result". (Marr, BBC 1, News At Ten, April 9, 2003)</unknownNode><unknownNode>This is the standard BBC version of objective news reporting. The UN secretary-general, Kofi Annan, took a different view of the invasion:</unknownNode><unknownNode>"From our point of view and from the [UN] charter point of view, it was illegal."</unknownNode><unknownNode>Indeed it would be hard to find a better example of the supreme war crime - the waging of a war of aggression.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Before the invasion, Bush and Blair insisted that the pretext was a "single question": Would Iraq eliminate its weapons of mass destruction? As late as February 2003, Blair affirmed that Saddam could still save his regime:  "I hope, even now, Iraq can be disarmed peacefully, with or without Saddam."</unknownNode><unknownNode>When not a single weapon of mass destruction was found, the story quickly changed and BBC reporting changed with it: the liberation of Iraq, not its disarmament, we were told, was the guiding concern. The BBC's Washington correspondent, Matt Frei, said:</unknownNode><unknownNode>"There's no doubt that the desire to bring good, to bring American values to the rest of the world, and especially now to the Middle East... is now increasingly tied up with military power."

While we are concentrating solely on those in Iraq, former BBC correspondent Martin Bell has been looking at their role across all current conflicts for a BBC Radio Four programme, God and the Gun. One Padre who took part in that programme spoke to the BBC News website.</unknownNode><unknownNode>In the Commons, MP's vote on Trident; in the Lords, peers decide on whether to vote themselves out of existence (in their current form); Mark Pieth (Chair of the anti-bribery committee of the OECD) talks to Peter Marshall; Blue Peter is the latest show in the TV quiz spotlight - we look back at some of the programme's other great TV moments; and will the loos be flushed away in one Norfolk town?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Leave your comments on Wednesday's programme below.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Newsnight is following a number of people in Iraq over the coming weeks in order to gain some perspective on the situation across the country. Window on Iraq will feature a series of text, audio and video blogs hosted by Baghdad blogger Salam Pax - who will be posting regular entries himself.  In this, his first, he examines claims that the situation in Baghdad is improving.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Just a day before the recent international meeting in Baghdad many news sources published a piece about the Iraqi PM making a surprise appearance on the streets of Baghdad where he told reporters that "the conference is proof that the situation in Baghdad is getting back to normal and that the political process is strong and stable" (emphasis mine). If you ask me the headline to that piece should have read: Iraqi PM moves into his own Reality Distortion Field, finds it a very lonely place. </unknownNode><unknownNode>It seems Mr. Maliki's idea of what "normal" looks like is suffering from a severe case of Green Zone delusional disorder from spending all that time in the little oasis of false calm in that heavily fortified American enclave. Walking in the centre of a tightly closed circle of machine gun wielding bodyguards does seem to stretch any definition of normal you want to choose.</unknownNode><unknownNode>And as another indication of normalcy "his Iraqi bodyguards, armed with submachine guns, parted to allow al-Maliki to stoop down and kiss the foreheads of children huddled up against cement barriers." Now how is that for a "all is normal, folks" campaign poster? We obviously don't see him hurrying back to his armoured car right after the photo op.</unknownNode><unknownNode>The situation, dear Mr. Maliki, is far from normal. </unknownNode><unknownNode>And I will refuse to describe it as normal until I can move back into the home my family and I had to abandon two years ago when the neighbourhood was taken over by insurgents.</unknownNode><unknownNode>I had not been to my old house since we moved out and as the months went by I had less and less reason to do so. One after the other, my uncles and aunts who also lived in the same area, rented homes elsewhere or left the country. But yesterday I did go and now I wish I hadn't, I would rather remember my neighbourhood the way it was than see what it turned to now.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Not a single shop was open in the 1.5km stretch of the main shopping street, and from the amount of rubbish and rubble in front of these shops no one has bothered with opening these shops for a very long time. Cars which have caught fire during an explosion a couple of weeks ago are still there on the side of the road and more inexplicably the twisted and burned remains a huge 40 passenger bus can be seen at the entrance to one of the side streets.  The top of the street is flanked by the rubble of what used to be two flashy five story buildings. One was destroyed by a car bomb about a month ago and the second by two mortar rounds hitting it just last week. The only signs of life were the armed guards of a Sunni political group standing on the roof of a building they have commandeered, it used to be the Baath Party headquarters in the area.</unknownNode><unknownNode>The feeling you get driving down that street is of despair. People who have hope don't leave burned cars at the entrance of the street they live in. Although they would leave it there hoping that whoever has done this will have some mercy the next time and spare them another attack. People who still have hope in Mr. Maliki's political process go to pick the pieces of their shattered stores and repair the broken window panes. I know what having hope feels like because for two years after the war we did that, Baghdadis tried to act as if nothing was going wrong and tried to keep their lives on track. Today despair and hopelessness can be seen around every corner you turn in the west of Baghdad where I used to live. A place Mr. Maliki has obviously never been to.</unknownNode><unknownNode>I didn't make it our house. The empty streets and all the bombed buildings scared me and saddened me more than I expected them to and I decided to turn around and go back. My mother did not want to hear about what I saw, keeping things how you remember them is a much wiser decision.</unknownNode><unknownNode>As part of Salam Pax's Window on Iraq series of text, audio and video blogs, Baghdad student Ahmed's first audio entry describes the difficulties of student life in Iraq's capital.</unknownNode><unknownNode>These days the most difficult thing in my life is going through the streets of Baghdad. Besides the bombs and explosions we have to deal with many other troubles which guarantee a late arrival at university.</unknownNode><unknownNode>I travel to university in a taxi I hire with a couple of friends and while this makes travelling to university cheap as a group of young men in a car it also means that we get stopped at every check point. </unknownNode><unknownNode>There are also many new laws which make it even more difficult. For example there is the odd and even law; on one day only cars with odd numbers are allowed on the roads and only even numbers on the next. The aim was to reduce the number of cars on the streets and to keep the car bombs in check. But for us it means that we must have two cars to really be able to move around daily or use unreliable, crowded buses.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Another law strange law prohibits you from using a mobile phone when in a car. Not while driving but just while sitting in a car within sight of a check point. They are afraid you might trigger a bomb. But how do you call your family to tell them you are late because of road blocks not because you have been kidnapped? Or that the car bomb they just heard about is not near you and you&rsquo;re still alive? For us mobile phones are our lifelines.</unknownNode><unknownNode>On a good day getting to my university is only a 15 minute drive. On foot it is half hours away. I know because I recently had to walk all the way. </unknownNode><unknownNode>I had an exam on the day the new security plan started and found that no cars were allowed to cross the bridge. </unknownNode><unknownNode>It was strange but nice to be walking on the streets with no cars. But I am my friends saw a couple of American Humvees on the side of the road we thought that could be trouble. You have to be careful when walking near American Army vehicles. They could be attacked and you end up as a casualty of that or the Americans might panic and shoot you. We found a small side street and quickly got into it.</unknownNode><unknownNode>In the end I had to run as the exam was going to start without me. I was allowed in even though I was five minutes late and I sat for 15 minutes catching my breath before even looking at the questions. </unknownNode><unknownNode>I have not yet received my grades but I have a feeling that my best score is going to be for the test on that day.</unknownNode><unknownNode> Environment Minister David Miliband talks about the government&rsquo;s radical climate change proposals; the expensive court martial that has produced few answers about the death of Baha Mousa; seeking confidence in government statistics; and ITV Play is sacrificed, but what about the newspaper industry&rsquo;s involvement with premium rate phone lines?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Comment on Tuesday&rsquo;s programme here.</unknownNode><unknownNode>From Irbil in northern Iraq, Kurdish journalist Mohammed A Salih records concerns about local troops being sent to Baghdad.</unknownNode><unknownNode>The other day, I woke early to go out for my usual reporting job.</unknownNode><unknownNode>The taxi driver tuned the radio to one of the local stations. The main story was about the sending of 1,800 Kurdish troops to Baghdad as part of the new Iraqi-American security plan to stabilise the capital.</unknownNode><unknownNode>This is in addition to a Kurdish brigade that left for Baghdad a few weeks ago. I could see the panic and dissatisfaction on the faces of the other taxi passengers.</unknownNode><unknownNode>"I see no sense whatsoever in sending our [Kurdish] soldiers to Baghdad," said the driver in a very disgruntled voice.</unknownNode><unknownNode>"I swear by God, the same with me," said the passenger in front sitting next to him.</unknownNode><unknownNode>"Just tell me what they can achieve in the chaos over there."</unknownNode><unknownNode>In no time I was in the middle of a heated debate about the general situation in Iraq. Although Kurdistan in the north has been spared much of the bloodshed of other parts of the country, many here are worried that with Kurds fighting in Baghdad, the violence may spill over in to Kurdistan.</unknownNode><unknownNode>"We can't calm down the situation in Baghdad," said someone sitting next to me.</unknownNode><unknownNode>"We would become part of the problem and would start receiving the dead bodies of our fighters everyday."</unknownNode><unknownNode>"It's not our business to get involved in the fighting between Arabs. Let them sort it out themselves," the driver yelled.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Kurds, who are ethnically distinct from Arabs, have very little sense of Iraqi identity these days. The accounts of persecution at the hand of Saddam Hussein's regime are still very fresh in their memories. While feeling deeply sorry about the bloodshed in the rest of the country, they still believe "we must not be involved".</unknownNode><unknownNode>The discussion reflected how unpopular the move to send Kurdish soldiers to Baghdad is with the ordinary people here. The next news item was about a deadly bombing in front of a university in Baghdad. The driver sighed deeply.</unknownNode><unknownNode>"This is brutality. Whose conscience can accept doing this? All these poor innocent students dying. What for?"</unknownNode><unknownNode>Others nodded in agreement.</unknownNode><unknownNode>With sectarian divisions running deep in Iraq today, US and Iraqi officials hope that Kurdish soldiers can keep the peace in Baghdad. The Kurds are neither affiliated with, nor against any of the conflicting Shia and Sunni Arabs there. But most of the people I talked to in Irbil, Iraqi Kurdistan's regional capital, didn't like the idea. They doubt Kurdish soldiers can make any positive contribution to the deteriorating security situation in Iraq.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Many of them question what Kurdish soldiers can do when tens of thousands of well-equipped Iraqi and American troops cannot change things for better. They feel the presence of Kurdish soldiers can only create more targets and increase the number of dead. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Do we need to spend &pound;20bn on "independent nuclear deterrent".

The photo was published in several national newspapers two weeks ago, and commentators suggested that the scene of Mr. Cameron and his toffish chums was far more embarrassing to the Tory leader than the recent story about him taking cannabis at Eton.</unknownNode><unknownNode>But last week Gillman and Soame, the Oxford photographers who took the original Bullingdon picture, and who own the copyright, announced they were no longer giving permission for the media to use the photo (or indeed any other of their library of tens of thousands of student and school photos).

So I was more than a little nervous when Newsnight asked me to give my husband&rsquo;s finances the ethical once-over.</unknownNode><unknownNode>This all came about as a result of my revelation, seven month&rsquo;s into Justin&rsquo;s stint as Newsnight&rsquo;s Ethical Man, that he had quietly held onto a small but profitable shareholding in an oil company. </unknownNode><unknownNode>So I&rsquo;d got my hands on his filthy lucre. My first instinct was to sell the shares and give all the money to charity &ndash; not something Justin does very often. But this is supposed to be an exercise in ethical finance. So here&rsquo;s the question: is it ok for an ethical man to hold shares in an oil company?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Justin&rsquo;s shares - as a portion of the oil company &ndash; equate to over four tonnes of carbon. Add that to our family&rsquo;s carbon footprint and it would increase it by a whopping 40% - from 10 to 14 tonnes. As Justin&rsquo;s wife, this is my footprint too: I was ready to flog the shares there and then.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>Then our carbon guru, Professor Tim Jackson, pointed out that it&rsquo;s the people who pump Justin&rsquo;s company&rsquo;s product into their cars and factories who end up &ldquo;owning&rdquo; the carbon cost.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>But surely by making a profit from the oil industry you must be held at least partially responsible for its consequences? </unknownNode><unknownNode>Justin argues that there is nothing inherently wrong with investing in an oil company. He pointed out that we all use oil in one form or another, and it has to come from somewhere. But I suspected that not all oil companies are the same.</unknownNode><unknownNode>My job was made more difficult because the oil company in question refused to participate. So I tried several other British oil companies instead. They wouldn&rsquo;t take part either. Were they all feeling a little vulnerable about their activities?</unknownNode><unknownNode>This wasn&rsquo;t to be the only rebuff I encountered. I went to a glamorous City event celebrating five years of the FTSE4Good, an index that encourages corporate social responsibility. And even here - despite the flowing champagne - the big business leaders refused to discuss their ethical credentials with me. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Naturally the anti-oil industry campaigners were all too happy to talk, and I also got some help from ethical fund managers and other city sources. Even the Environment Secretary, a man tipped to be the future prime minister, stepped into the fray to advise on what Justin should do.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Here&rsquo;s what I told them: the company Justin has invested his money in shares in is a relatively small company specialising in oil exploration. As oil companies go it isn&rsquo;t remarkably bad, but then it isn&rsquo;t especially good either. (I found no records of the company even hinting at green technologies like carbon sequestration or bio-fuels.)</unknownNode><unknownNode>So should I keep the shares, or should I sell them?  And if I sell them, what should I do with the profits...?</unknownNode><unknownNode>I turned to a very ethical man indeed - a Canon, no less.  Canon Christopher Hall is a life-long environmental campaigner. He also has shares in Shell Oil.  His advice was that the best way to deal with the ethical conundrums posed by the shares was&hellip; to keep them!</unknownNode><unknownNode>He argues that the best way to change companies is from within. At last year&rsquo;s AGM, he lobbied Shell to change their corporate behaviour, and persuaded another &pound;10-billion-worth of shareholders to defy the board. </unknownNode><unknownNode>I find this compelling, but would the shareholder in question, my husband Justin, feel the same? Justin is no campaigner.  He didn&rsquo;t seem to know much his company&rsquo;s activities, and by his own admission he has never so much as been to an AGM. </unknownNode><unknownNode>My mind was made up &ndash; the shares had to go. Now I needed to find something ethical to do with the profits. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Ethical finance is a subjective business. There are some things you simply don&rsquo;t do: nukes, tobacco and arms.  But after that, it is a bit of a pick &lsquo;n&rsquo; mix. You choose what matters to you &ndash; be it animal rights, religion, human rights, the environment &ndash; and then you select your investments accordingly. </unknownNode><unknownNode>I was told that as well as excluding companies that &ldquo;behave badly&rdquo;, I could also use my investment to encourage good: to put pressure on companies and keep them under scrutiny. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Not only that, you&rsquo;ve got to decide how &ldquo;good&rdquo; you want the companies you invest in to be. Ethical investment indices for environmental investments range from so-called dark green (very ethical!) to light green (more mainstream). </unknownNode><unknownNode>Given that Justin has the weighty title of Ethical Man to live up to, I didn&rsquo;t mess around. Only a dark green fund was good enough for us. I knew his first question would be &ldquo;But will it make money?&rdquo; but reassuringly the fund has consistently out-performed the FTSE average.</unknownNode><unknownNode>But I also held some money back. Because I&rsquo;m with all the people who have written in to Ethical Man to say that being ethical isn&rsquo;t just about being green &ndash; it&rsquo;s about being good. I still wanted to give some of that oil money to charity. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Giving to charity is a private matter, but I was surprised to find out that around a third of the British public rarely or never gives at all. Sadly Ethical Man falls into this category, the extent of his charitable giving is limited to a direct debit to Oxfam for the princely sum of &pound;2 a month (and I&rsquo;m sorry to add that it was me who set this up for him). </unknownNode><unknownNode>Just for fun I let Justin believe that I was going to give away the whole lot. But ultimately it is his money. Realistically 20% of it struck me as a figure I thought he&rsquo;d find hard to argue against. I chose to target somewhere I felt the money would have the best impact, and so have chosen two small charities in which I have a personal interest:</unknownNode><unknownNode>Friends of Colombia and Elizabeth Blunt School.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Not everyone has a share portfolio of course. But many of us have some savings or perhaps a baby bond to invest. So why let it languish in a bank when it could be out there doing some good, and maybe making you some money too!</unknownNode><unknownNode>Bee Rowlatt's film on Ethical investments will be shown on Newsnight at 2230GMT on BBC Two and on the Newsnight website on Tuesday 20 Feb.</unknownNode><unknownNode>In a scheme that hopes to encourage a generation of new young entrepreneurs, 10,000 school children were given &pound;10 for a month to see if they could make a profit.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Newsnight is following one scheme, Cathay Craftz, and its entrepreneurs are blogging their progress here on Talk About Newsnight.</unknownNode><unknownNode>We've had a quiet but busy half term.

If your answer is Michael Howard, the then Home Secretary, then you, in common with most people, are entirely wrong. But you'd be pretty well justified in thinking it as you've probably read that version of reality in every paper in the land at one time or another, possibly even this week. Plenty of people at Newsnight seem to believe it's true too.   Journalists are busy people. You can't expect us to check ALL the facts. Especially the ones we already know. I don't check that Tony Blair is Prime Minister before I put it in a script. And likewise no-one ever checks that Michael Howard was Home Secretary when Jeremy asked him THAT question 14 times back in the 1990's (watch it here). Except of course he wasn't. It's an urban myth. A quick google reveals that the date of the interview, 13 May 1997, was after the election. If Howard HAD still been Home Secretary rather than a flagging party leadership candidate, it's hard to imagine he would have put himself in such a horrendous position in the first place. But one shouldn't let the facts get in the way of a better story. And by the way, it was 12 times and not 14.</unknownNode><unknownNode> 						Continue reading "Myths and Fables" 					</unknownNode><unknownNode>Ethical Man has discovered a whole range of food additives don&rsquo;t even get listed on the ingredients.</unknownNode><unknownNode>I&rsquo;m spending a month as vegan to see how cutting animal products out of my diet will affect my environmental footprint.

And Geek Week: who are we in cyberspace? </unknownNode><unknownNode>Comment on Wednesday's programme.</unknownNode><unknownNode>I don&rsquo;t mean one of your stray locks that fell into the butter.  What I want to know is whether amino acids produced from human hair were used to process the flour that went to make that piece of toast you wolfed down on the way to the bus stop.</unknownNode><unknownNode>It sounds unthinkable doesn&rsquo;t it?  But since I became a vegan on New Year&rsquo;s day I&rsquo;ve developed a keen interest in what goes into the food I eat and I&rsquo;ve discovered that a food additive which is sometimes produced from human hair can be used as an additive in some baked goods. </unknownNode><unknownNode>But first, the veganism.  I am not becoming a vegan out of high principle.  The idea is to test the claim made by a number of people who have emailed in to insist that becoming a vegan significantly reduces one&rsquo;s impact on the environment. </unknownNode><unknownNode>I will be vegan for all of January.   So my new diet did not preclude me eating Ned the Newsnight turkey </unknownNode><unknownNode>I am happy to report that Ned was as tasty as he was ethical.  My family gnawed our way through his ample carcass over the course of a full week.  We ate Ned roast on the big day, then sandwiched, curried, as a supreme and finally in a tasty soup.  Then, as the last few slices of Ned grew an extravagant mould in the bottom of our fridge, the New Year turned and my diet became completely meat and dairy free.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>It is not easy.  I&rsquo;m not just cutting meat and fish out of my diet.  Vegans don&rsquo;t eat any animal products including milk, eggs and honey.  So will cutting out all animal products reduce my carbon footprint?</unknownNode><unknownNode>I need a bit of persuading about the bees but cows certainly produce an impressive quantity of greenhouse gases.  I cited the extraordinary figure of up to 500 litres of methane a day per animal when I announced this project in December.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>At a conference last week the environment secretary David Milliband pointed out that "the livestock sector generates more greenhouse gas emissions than transport".  Agriculture is reckoned to account for 7% of all greenhouse gas emissions, about the same as aviation.</unknownNode><unknownNode>And methane isn&rsquo;t the only issue.  It is claimed that one acre of arable crops can produce enough food for up to 20 people.  Turn that field over to beef production and it will feed just one person.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Not only that, raising animals is a lot more carbon intensive than growing vegetables.  David Pimentel, an ecologist from Cornell University, has calculated that animal protein production requires more than eight times as much fossil-fuel energy than plant protein yet yields proteins only 1.4 times as nutritious for humans.</unknownNode><unknownNode>That&rsquo;s the average.  When you look at individual sectors the figures are even more startling.  Take beef, for example.  Using US Department of Agriculture figures he found that beef production requires an energy input to protein output of 54:1 (as well as 100,000 litres of water per kilogram of meat).</unknownNode><unknownNode>Vegetarians shouldn&rsquo;t feel too smug, though.  Milk protein has a ratio of 17:1.  In fact, rather depressingly the most efficient form of animal production &ndash; perhaps not surprisingly &ndash; is battery chickens.  Pimentel finds that broiler chickens have a ratio of energy input to protein output of just 4:1.   My problem has been eradicating all these inefficient animal proteins from my diet.  Take my very first day of vegan living, New Year&rsquo;s Day.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>I hadn&rsquo;t prepared very well and hadn&rsquo;t got any margarine in.  The local corner shop, a Londis, was open and they stock a good range so I wasn&rsquo;t too worried.  But as I worked my way through the eight or so different varieties of margarine I was amazed to find that every single one contained milk or dairy products in some form.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>It makes you realise just how common the use of animal products in food is.  Before I became a vegan I would eat animal products in every single meal.  Indeed the Vegan Society points out that some vegans consider tap water unacceptable because it contains chemicals that have been tested on animals.</unknownNode><unknownNode>I am not going that far but I have certainly developed a mania for reading food labels and there are all sorts of unexpected animal additives.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>Most people know that gelatine is produced from animal skin and bones and that the rennet used in some cheeses comes from calves stomachs.  But did you know that bone char (from cow bones) is still occasionally used to whiten some sugars or that some wines and many beers (particularly real ales) include isinglass &ndash; a substance obtained from the swim bladders of fish?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Which brings me back to the possibility that human hair may be used in bread.  A vegetarian friend alerted me to the existence of an animal-based flour additive called L-Cysteine.  It is an amino acid which is used as a flour improver.  It is known as E920 and is permitted for use in all biscuits, breads and cakes except those that claim to be wholemeal.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>The problem for a would-be vegan like me is that traditionally L-Cysteine is produced from feathers, pig bristles and sometimes even human hair.  These days L-Cysteine can also be produced synthetically but apparently human hair remains one of the richest sources of this amino acid &ndash; it makes up about 14% of your hair - and there is a small industry in China making the additive from hair clippings.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>There&rsquo;s even a paper on the web written by a Rabbi about whether L-Cysteine from human hair is kosher.  Apparently it is &ndash; so long as the hair in question was not harvested from dead bodies.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>So how commonly is L-Cysteine used?  My vegetarian friend claims that the problem with E920 is that &ndash; even when it is used &ndash; it doesn&rsquo;t have to be listed in the ingredients.  She says that&rsquo;s because it is broken down in the baking process so the manufacturers argue that doesn&rsquo;t constitute an ingredient.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>That is something the Food Standards Agency flatly denies.  It says that L-Cysteine must always be labelled.  Indeed, the industry says the reason you so rarely see E920 on labels is that these days it is very rarely used (apparently it was much more common fifteen years ago).  The industry also says that the only L-Cysteine their members would use is the synthetic variety.</unknownNode><unknownNode>That is a little odd because according to the Food Standards Agency the European regulation specifies that only L-Cysteine produced from duck and chicken feathers or from pig bristles can be used.  That means that, so long as your daily bread was baked in Europe, it almost certainly does not include human hair.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>But it leaves me a little confused.  If British bakers are using synthetic L-Cysteine are they breaking EU guidelines?  It is hard to get a straight answer because the biscuit makers told me it would be added when the flour is milled and the millers say it something the bakers would add.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>So if anyone can put this hairy issue to bed once and for all I&rsquo;d be very grateful.  And while I am on the subject, if anyone knows of any other animal-based (or human-based) food ingredients an embryonic vegan like myself needs to steer clear of please do tell me. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Two big issues of the day: the so-called war on terror and climate change</unknownNode><unknownNode>First, US air strikes in Somalia aimed at al-Qaeda leaders in the region and Washington's plans for more troops in Iraq.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Then, we look at climate change and Nicholas Stern discusses the aftermath of his report and the government's response so far. </unknownNode><unknownNode>And for Geek Week 2.0 Roger Harrabin reports on the technologies that might save the planet.

I've even seen reports that claim that rats are now as numerous as people.   I've always been a bit sceptical of these stories.  The last time I came face-to-face with a rat was a couple of years ago outside the BBC.  I know what you are thinking but this one was of the rodent variety and ducked into the bushes as I passed.  I fear I may very soon establish a much more intimate acquaintance with our burrowing buddies.   When I went out to deposit the peelings and parings of the season in the compost I discovered evidence of what appears to be an assault on our bin.   I would insert a picture of the three inch diameter hole dug in the earth beneath the bin and the foot or so of debris sprayed out behind it but I am staying with Bee's mum for a couple of days and don't have the technical capability to do so.  I know that will make diagnosis difficult but please do your best.  What I want to know is whether this is indeed the work of a rat?  And if so, what can I do about it?   I was rather hoping that some keen-eyed zoologist would tell me that this is unmistakably the work of a fox.  It wouldn't surprise me, there are no shortage of foxes locally.   In fact our foxes have all the urban swagger of hip hop artists. You see them by and night, and they happily pass within feet of pedestrians with little more than a snarl and a glare.  But are they really likely to raid my compost?   I think the evidence suggests a smaller animal.  I've tried to flush whatever it is out. I've given the in a good kick and even prodded around with a garden fork (admittedly rather gingerly) in the compost itself.  The huge snarling rodent I was expecting did not materialise.   Before you ask I have been very scrupulous about not composting cooked food.  Our bin holds only garden waste, raw vegetable peelings, some shredded newspaper and the occasional eggshell or teabag.   I'm hoping that this was a single foray and that whatever invaded the bin was disappointed by what it found and will not return but I know that is probably optimistic. So, to misquote UB40, there's a rat in me compost, what me gonna do? </unknownNode><unknownNode>  </unknownNode><unknownNode>So if it wasn't Jimi Hendrix jammin' the Welsh national anthem who was it?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Yesterday you were all very sceptical that the man hailed by many as the greatest rock guitarist ever to have lifted a plectrum was behind this  - a kind of Electric Ladyland of My Fathers if you will.

I got to interview the new president of Bolivia during my trip there in March - it was touch and go because his press operation is not very attuned to outlets by the BBC but one night, after an attack of Boliivan lurgy, my producer dragged me out of bed to go and see a lecture by thevice president, on the pretext that if we met him,we might secure an audience with the main man. In the end, the vp did not show, disappointing an entire hall full of Catholic students, and my heavily perspiring and dizzy self. As we packed our cameras up our fixer took a mobile phone call. "It's on for tomorrow, you have your interview with Evo," she said nonchalantly: "We need to be at the palace by 5.30". Brilliant I said - a whole day to prepare for it. "No," she said, "They mean 5.30am"....</unknownNode><unknownNode> 						Continue reading "Evo, Didier, Tony, Lucy and Martin - memories of 2006" 					</unknownNode><unknownNode>Analysis of today's Russian energy moves; Oh My Newsnight winner announced; and what happened next? </unknownNode><unknownNode>Emily's on at 2230GMT, BBC Two and on the website.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Comment on Friday's programme below.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Happy holidays...</unknownNode><unknownNode>Last week I travelled up to Norfolk to meet my Christmas lunch in person for the first and last time.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>I have followed Ned the Newsnight turkey&rsquo;s progress from a lustrous chick into a magnificent one and a half stone stag. Now it was time for me to kill him.</unknownNode><unknownNode>I eat meat almost every day but I have never actually killed an animal.  As Ethical Man I reckoned that it was time to take full responsibility for my food.  An ethical man should be able to stomach dispatching his own supper or should decline to dine upon it, shouldn&rsquo;t he?</unknownNode><unknownNode>But having said that, killing Ned wasn&rsquo;t something I was looking forward to.  My mother-in-law&rsquo;s partner Dave was so upset after he killed two turkeys in a garden shed in York fifteen or so years ago that he&rsquo;s been a vegetarian ever since.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>I was consoled by the fact that Ned has had a good life.  In fact he&rsquo;s about as ethical a bird as you are ever likely to eat.  But, when the time came, I couldn&rsquo;t bring myself to wring his neck. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Wringing a turkey&rsquo;s neck takes a fair bit of skill.  You hang the bird by its feet, take a firm grip on its neck and then twist it slightly while pulling firmly down.  Tony, the most experienced turkey slaughterer on the farm, assured me that - when done correctly - the neck is broken in a second.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>So why didn&rsquo;t I do it?  I accept that morality shouldn&rsquo;t be size-based but a living, gobbling turkey is a surprisingly bulky beast and Ned&rsquo;s size was certainly off-putting.  The clincher, though, was that I was worried that, in my inexpert hands, Ned might suffer unnecessarily.</unknownNode><unknownNode>So it was Tony who saw to our Ned.  He flapped frantically for a minute or so after Tony had done his work, then twitched his last.  It was a distressing sight but Ned did not appear to feel any pain.</unknownNode><unknownNode>As soon as his body was still Tony and I started to pluck him.  The feathers come off much more easily in the moments after the bird has been killed.  Ned&rsquo;s body was surprisingly warm. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Then, a couple of days ago Ned turned up on my doorstep.  He was in a white cardboard box and looked smaller than I remembered him.  He&rsquo;s in the fridge now.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>I am confident that Ned will be delicious on Christmas day.  I am looking forward to stuffing him, seasoning him and popping him in the oven.  His giblets will make a rich gravy.</unknownNode><unknownNode>And, if you are wondering, I am not upset by having played such an intimate role in his death.  If anything, I think I should have mustered the courage to kill him myself.  In truth, I bottled out and I shouldn&rsquo;t have done.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>Because, let&rsquo;s be honest about this: carnivores can&rsquo;t afford to be squeamish.  Turkeys like Ned have to die if we are going to get our Christmas dinners.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>Anyway, I&rsquo;ll have all of January to reflect on the ethics of what I eat because I&rsquo;m becoming vegan.

It raised the thorny issue of class: and I thought since we've given the Tory A-list a sociological going over, what about Newsnight? </unknownNode><unknownNode>You may recall that the Beeb's bosses were distinctly unforthcoming about the level of poshness within the workforce here, when questioned by another media organisation. So I've organised a voluntary straw poll of the Newsnight team. </unknownNode><unknownNode>With 33 replies in the latest results are as follows:</unknownNode><unknownNode>I'll update this posting with the running totals, but the results so far, with about a third of those eligible having replied, are:</unknownNode><unknownNode>1) Were you privately educated? 42% (Tories 52%) 2) Did you go Oxbridge? 30% (Tories 28%) 3) Are you from the South? 60% (Tories 61%) 4) Did you have any history of working for the BBC before you joined it?* 21% (Tory equivalent question 89%) 5) Do you own a Labrador? 3% (Question not asked of all Tory A-listers)</unknownNode><unknownNode> (*This has a bearing on poshness because many years ago, before they brought in rules to make things fairer, apparently a lot of people whose dads were judges and bankers seemed to turn up for work experience.)</unknownNode><unknownNode>Some thought I should have asked the same question as last night - i.e. "ever worked for the Tory Party?"; others thought it would be more accurate to ask "ever worked for the Labour Party?". Likewise one respondent thought the result was such a no-brainer that I would have to narrow it down to "did you do PPE?" and "do you live in Islington, Hampstead or Camden?".</unknownNode><unknownNode>Anyway, the preliminary judgement is that Newsnight is not as posh as the A-list: we are just as southern as the Cameronistas, a little bit more Oxbridge educated, but far fewer of us went to public school. And only one person on the programme admits to owning a Labrador.

Well, apart from the Tellytubby style set (see our menu shot tonight) and rows about tax, the bars and cafes are filled with battle stories from the front or "How I Got My Conference Pass". People have queued for hours and hours yesterday and today in order to get in. Children's Commissioner Sir Al Aynsley-Green, Liberty director Shami Chakrabarti, former women's cricketer Rachael Heyhoe-Flint and several MPs were among those forced to wait. Environmental campaigner Zac Goldsmith missed a speaking slot at a conference fringe event when he was delayed.  And the party chairman Francis Maude has had to cancel a fringe in order to hold an emergency meeting with the police.  Shadow Cabinet ministers David Willets and Andrew Lansley were stuck outside (which doesn't say much for their profiles). Rumours are rife that Mr Lansley will have to sleep in his car because his hotel is inside the cordon.</unknownNode><unknownNode>If you do get stuck , then you wait inside the Pavilion theatre where there is a risk you will become an audience for a speech whether you want to be or not. Iain Duncan Smith the former leader decided that if people couldn't get in, he would bring his fringe meeting to them. IDS takes socially excluded message to the conference's excluded is the headline on one Tory website. </unknownNode><unknownNode>One line of spin is that the reasons for the delays is because the Tories are victims of their own success - there are 2,000 more people here than last year.

Was there ever any real evidence that she had been abducted, or was it an assumption people were all too keen to make in the present climate where Muslims are being prejudged, just because they are Muslim? </unknownNode><unknownNode>Also, the forgotten plight of Gaza - a donors' conference in Stockholm is discussing what to do about the crisis in the Palestinian territories, alongside its discussions on reconstruction in Lebanon, but is it all hot air?</unknownNode><unknownNode>And Tony Blair's loyal MPs. Just how loyal are they?</unknownNode><unknownNode>We welcome your thoughts on the programme.</unknownNode><unknownNode>John Reid gave himself 100 days to sort out the Home Office &ndash; has he succeeded? Is it time to allow people to buy a kidney if they need it? And a look at Qatar&rsquo;s schools &ndash; who has the best education service in the world? Comment on Thursday&rsquo;s programme below.</unknownNode><unknownNode> The Human Tissue Act which comes into force overnight means for the first time it will be legal for living individuals to donate organs to complete strangers out of purely altruistic motives. However, they won't be allowed to do it for hard cash.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Given the scale of organ shortages in the UK &ndash; the waiting list for kidneys alone stands at over 5,000 - and the flourishing black market in transplants overseas, isn't it time we sanctioned cash-for-kidneys? </unknownNode><unknownNode>How worried should we be about Iran&rsquo;s nuclear programme? What difference has our stem cells investigation made to people who were planning to travel abroad for treatment? Is the super casino at the Dome a done deal? And when will we get mobile phones that are able to do everything? Discuss Wednesday&rsquo;s edition of Newsnight here.</unknownNode><unknownNode>This question has been bugging me ever since so much paint came off my SonyEricsson P900 that I decided to upgrade this year to the new model. I have blagged a P990 (which is launched in the UK 1 September) and been trying it out. The problem is, though it's got Wifi and a better camera, it's clear we are years away from a smart mobile device that can replace wallet, keys, ID card, credit card etc. But, as my research has shown me, only a few years. Here's why:</unknownNode><unknownNode> 						Continue reading "When Am I Going To Get a Mobile That Does Everything" 					</unknownNode><unknownNode>What do you think of the redesigned and pruned website? Thanks for all the comments and suggestions you've sent in. Many raised similar themes and we've tried to incorporate or reflect most of them. The result is, we hope, less cluttered, clearer and much easier to navigate. And, as many of you requested, we've killed the GorDaq.</unknownNode><unknownNode>I&rsquo;ve been trying to get a wind turbine ever since I first had the title Ethical Man foisted on me by the Newsnight editor six months ago.  Wind turbines are this year&rsquo;s must have eco-accessory and I was keen to bolt my new credentials firmly to the roof of my terraced house.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>I live in a borough that boasts about how green it is but getting the planning permission I need has not been easy.  My application didn&rsquo;t get any formal complaints from neighbours but Camden still wanted me to undertake an expensive acoustic survey.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>Meanwhile I&rsquo;ve had to watch as ethical fellow travellers David Cameron, the Tory leader, and Malcolm Wicks, the Energy Minister, have been granted permission for their turbines despite local opposition.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>Then today my wait came to an end.  On Friday Camden council decided that I could install my environmental virility symbol on my home, though my permit only allows for a temporary erection &ndash; six months only.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>As an ethical man, I wish Messrs Cameron and Wicks all the best with their turbines, but I thank Camden that at last I am back in the race.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>The sale of false stem cell treatments; Uganda's ceasefire; and an interview with Michael Brown, the federal emergency chief who became the fall guy for Washington's inept handling of the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.  Tell us what you think of Tuesday's programme here.</unknownNode><unknownNode>What this country needs most is a new initiative. Ok, no one has quite said that. But once again this government's wracking its brain to figure out what to do to bring communities together to wipe out extremism. </unknownNode><unknownNode>That will not include examining whether faith schools are a good thing or not. Indeed more are planned by the government. Church of England Schools are the most diverse in the country, according to Education Secretary Ruth Kelly. And as it&rsquo;s all about giving parents choice, Muslim parents should have the same opportunities offered to Christian and Jewish parents, she says.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Critics claim faith schools increase segregation on religious grounds and opening more at a time when religious understanding and tolerance are particularly fragile is a mistake. Ms Kelly&rsquo;s answer is for faith schools to play each other at football, cricket and the like.</unknownNode><unknownNode>So can faith schools have a part to play in this debate, given that none of the suicide bombers we know of even attended one? Is the blame too often laid unfairly at their door? Or should we be looking to end segregation right where it begins, in the infant school playground?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Tonight we interview the two Muslim men who were kicked off a charter flight home from Malaga - not as a result of intensive security checks but of suspicions voiced by fellow passengers. </unknownNode><unknownNode>They appear to have taken the experience rather well - and admit they "collapsed laughing" when they realised what had happened. So was this a case of what one senior met officer called "the new crime of flying whilst Muslim" - a phrase he coined on the programme just a week earlier? Or was their behaviour sinister enough - as fellow passengers still insist - to justify the actions taken?  </unknownNode><unknownNode>Has passenger profiling has already begun - "vigilante style" and is this type of incident only likely to increase if the public take to their heart the oft-heard call to be "the eyes and ears in the war against terror"?</unknownNode><unknownNode>&ldquo;You can taste blood in your mouth, your lungs are burning, your legs are screaming at you.  If you don&rsquo;t believe in yourself you are not going to get there&rdquo;.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>Sounds like fun doesn&rsquo;t it?  It&rsquo;s what one of Britain&rsquo;s most promising young rowers, eighteen year old Mohamed Sbihi, says it takes to win a world class race.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>He&rsquo;s not someone who&rsquo;d ever considered rowing until a team from GB Rowing turned up at his urban comprehensive armed with measuring tapes and strength testing machines.  To Mo&rsquo;s surprise they told him he was one of the estimated one in 10,000 of us who have what it takes to make it to the very top of world sport.</unknownNode><unknownNode>We feature Mo and his partner Charles Cousins in a report on tonight&rsquo;s programme about how UK Sport is searching for the next generation of sporting superstars to compete at the run up to London 2012.  The body has been given almost &pound;600 million in total to develop top talent, now it needs to find the athletes to spend it on&hellip;.and UK Sport has asked Newsnight to help. </unknownNode><unknownNode> 						Continue reading "Going for gold" 					</unknownNode><unknownNode>We'll be going big on immigration tonight, as new Government figures (download the pdf document here) confirm that the number of migrants who've come from East European EU states since their accession has been around 600,000 - many times higher than they predicted. What should be done now? </unknownNode><unknownNode>&amp;bull;a. Nothing - the more the merrier, our economy needs more migrants </unknownNode><unknownNode>&amp;bull;b. impose quotas on immigrants from existing EU countries </unknownNode><unknownNode>&amp;bull;c. take urgent action to prevent another wave of immigrants coming from Romania and Bulgaria  </unknownNode><unknownNode>And would your answer stay the same if Britain's economy starts to slow down? Let us know.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Summer would not be summer without members of the Labour hierarchy knocking lumps out of each other with handbags marked "policy renewal". Stephen Byers' gambit yesterday - to scrap inheritance tax because it is a "tax on hard work" - seems to be more than just the traditional phenomenon of Labour rightwingers getting very sentimental about money in old age: it contains a genuine philosophical challenge to Labour tax policy...</unknownNode><unknownNode> 						Continue reading "Laffing all the way to the bank?" 					</unknownNode><unknownNode>Meet the Newsnight turkey.  Not some duff story that will make the editor cringe when he sees it, but the bright eyed bird that will grace the table of Ethical Man and his family this Christmas.</unknownNode><unknownNode>I know some in the Ethical Man audience will not be pleased to see Ned &ndash; as the farmer has called him.  Some of Ethical Man&rsquo;s most consistent correspondents are vegans arguing that the only ethical diet is one that is free of all animal products.</unknownNode><unknownNode> 						Continue reading "Another BBC Turkey" 					</unknownNode><unknownNode>Most journalists use the phrase 'conspiracy theory' as an insult. Not because they're arch-rationalists who never entertain such notions in private but because if they publish something controversial and can't back it up, big trouble follows. You lot can say what you like about Diana and flying saucers and JFK, but hacks stick to the evidence, at least until they get down the pub.   But as the internet takes over the media mainstream, conspiracy theory (CT) journalism is getting a much wider airing than it ever used to, whereas the official version (OV) is no longer shifting copy like it did. So we present our net veteran Adam Livingstone's personal rule-of-thumb guide to believing CTs and OVs:</unknownNode><unknownNode> 						Continue reading "On internet conspiracy theories" 					</unknownNode><unknownNode>I am still very new to the world of blogging but already I am beginning to understand why so many people &ndash; including a number of my colleagues here at Newsnight &ndash; have become obsessed by it.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>Journalists just love to talk about what people think about what they do.  But our audience hasn&rsquo;t always entered into the discussion.  The audience figures show that about a million people watch Newsnight each night yet sometimes we get no virtually feedback whatsoever.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>I say &ldquo;virtually no feedback&rdquo; because we do get at least two calls every night.  These are made regardless of who is presenting the programme.  One says that Jeremy is rude to guests.  The other says that Newsnight is not worth watching without Jeremy presenting.</unknownNode><unknownNode> 						Continue reading "Off message" 					</unknownNode><unknownNode>All week the BBC has been looking at the impact of the baby boomer generation in the run-up to the 60th birthday spectacular of the archetypal boomer Bill Clinton on Saturday.</unknownNode><unknownNode>The political, cultural, industrial and academic worlds on both sides of the Atlantic are currently dominated by baby boomers. This post-war generation has changed our world and are still in charge of it. But have they changed it for the better or worse? When we come to take stock, when the next generation take power, what will the legacy of the baby boomers be?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Are you a baby boomer, or someone who resents their domination of Western politics and culture?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Tonight we&rsquo;ll be discussing baby boomer's impact with &ndash; amongst others - one of its most vocal members, Arianna Huffington. What do you want us to ask her and the others?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Or is he destined to fail like Michael Howard, Iain Duncan Smith and William Hague before him?</unknownNode><unknownNode>On the day Dave unveiled the final version of his 'Built to Last' document outlining his vision for the future of the Conservative Party, Newsnight will be examining the Cameron revolution. Is DC laying the foundations of a bright Conservative future? Or is he just a wolf in sheep's clothing, all spin and no substance? Can a party of the right really prioritise the environment and the health of public services above tax cuts? </unknownNode><unknownNode>What do you think?</unknownNode><unknownNode>You can watch the report and debate - with Shadow Education Secretary David Willets - here.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Here in the newsroom we are watching live pictures of Boston airport baggage handlers roughly throwing a bunch of Brit passengers' luggage on the tarmac for a dog to sniff. According to wire reports the London-Washington flight was diverted because of a "confrontation" after a female passenger acting suspiciously was found to be in possession of matches, vaseline, a screwdriver and a note referring to Al Qaeda. Now who would get on a jet carrying this in current circumstances? Instant profiling by cynical members of the Newsnight team suggest a) a terrorist b) a tabloid journalist. As the old joke goes: Q. What's the difference? A. At least terrorists have supporters. Its all happening right now and we'll have the definitive take by 10.30GMT.</unknownNode><unknownNode>In the land where car is king Portland Oregon is something of an anomaly. The city has developed its infrastructure with a series of public/private finance schemes coupled with targeted urban regeneration. </unknownNode><unknownNode>The local transport department even sought to prove how robust the city's transport is by challenging a group of residents to ditch their SUVs and station wagons and get on their bikes, city buses, trains and trams.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Sayeeda Warsi, vice chair of the Conservative Party and our reporter tonight, believes that the city&rsquo;s integrated transport scheme is way ahead of anything the UK has to offer in terms of urban living, public health and limiting environmental impact. Read her piece here - and watch the film here.</unknownNode><unknownNode>We went there as part of our search for the best public services in the world, and Portland&rsquo;s transport scheme seemed to fit that bill. Sayeeda Warsi, a self-confessed petrolhead, was convinced. Are you? Do you know of somewhere with a better approach?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Can you be neutral in the so-called war on terror? </unknownNode><unknownNode>Tonight we'll be exploring the arguments for and against the proposition that the time is coming when everyone will have to decide which side they're on. </unknownNode><unknownNode>A majority of the British public opposed the Iraq war and Tony Blair's position on the war in Lebanon, yet the vast majority also abhor Islamic terrorism in the UK. Are those positions compatible? Bush and Blair seem to think not. </unknownNode><unknownNode>But what of the other argument, that these events can't be lumped together, that problems with the Islamic world could be resolved by a change in foreign policy, and the West's current approach is only making matters worse? </unknownNode><unknownNode>What do you think?</unknownNode><unknownNode>Well my colleague Paul Mason couldn't have been more frank about the difference between a blog and a diary.  He says it is that "people who think you are an a*****e can say so immediately and have it hosted by the BBC!". Quite an opportunity, I'd have thought.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>So I was pretty pleased with my first haul. Most of my correspondents seemed to look fairly favourably on my ethical endeavours.  Even my very first respondee, Kate, who wrote to tell me "this "ethical man" crap has to be one of the worst ideas newsnight (sic) has ever had" - rather paradoxically concluded her message by wishing me good luck with the blog.</unknownNode><unknownNode>So here's another one of my ethical confessions...</unknownNode><unknownNode> 						Continue reading "A hybrid world" 					</unknownNode><unknownNode>In the 1980s, when the IRA was active and I was a scruffy youth with a Northern Ireland accent, I always used to get properly turned over at the airport flying to and from Belfast. Now, in a different era with a different threat, and a slightly neater haircut, I don't tend to. Fair enough, or not?</unknownNode><unknownNode> 						Continue reading "Passenger profiling - right or wrong?" 					</unknownNode><unknownNode>It turns out yesterday was a good day to open up the Newsnight blog: 150+ people have weighed into the debate on yesterday's alleged terror plot. As you saw on Newsnight last night, and as the BBC's Asian Network found on its phone-in this morning, there is a wave of cynicism and mistrust about what the government is telling us in the wake of the attacks. It is not confined to Muslims; also it is completely absent from American viewers/'readers. But it breaks down into three positions: 1) Some people believe that yesterday's alleged plot was staged by the British state - they also believe that 9/11 and 7/7 were carried out by the security services of the west, or Israel. 2) Others, remembering Forest Gate and the shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes, doubt the ability of the Metropolitan Police to get the right people; fear that innocent people may have been caught up in yesterday's arrests. A variant of this view is that it is "all too convenient" that John Reid makes a speech on terror one day and the next day a major terror plot is discovered, right in the middle of a politically damaging war in Lebanon....</unknownNode><unknownNode> 						Continue reading "A wave of cynicism hits the blog" 					</unknownNode><unknownNode>We awake to news that a major terror plot has been thwarted. Security sources claim that the group, who have been under surveillance for months, wanted to explode as many as 10 planes, probably somewhere over the Atlantic. Thousands of travellers are stranded, planes have been cancelled and the country's security threat has been raised to its highest level. There are a lot of questions we'll be trying to answer during the course of the day, for example:</unknownNode><unknownNode>1. how close were we to "mass murder on an unimaginable scale"? 2. have the security services found any explosives?  3. why did the police decide to swoop today?  4. were they members of a foreign terror cell or were they British-born? 5. how will this change the way we fly? Will we have to get used to flying without any hand luggage?</unknownNode><unknownNode>There are plenty more - let us know what questions you'd like answered, or if you can answer any of these.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Microsoft, Google, Skype and Yahoo were slammed today in a 149 page report from Human Rights Watch over their assistance to the Chinese authorities in censoring the Internet. It says: </unknownNode><unknownNode>"The above companies are complicit in the Chinese government&rsquo;s censorship of political and religious information and/or the monitoring of peaceful speech in various ways&mdash;and, it is important to note, to widely varying degrees. They have all accepted at least some Chinese government demands without mounting any meaningful challenge to them."...</unknownNode><unknownNode> 						Continue reading "Heard the news in China? No they haven't" 					</unknownNode><unknownNode>We are all getting a lot more letters and emails than normal because of the Middle East crisis; clearly an issue on which people do have strong feelings. </unknownNode><unknownNode>I perhaps should make it clear that generally we aren't getting secret instructions either from the Israeli government or Hezbollah as some correspondents have suggested. </unknownNode><unknownNode>In fact the only words in my earpiece come from Digital Dorothy. We no longer have a human PA in the gallery to give us timings because it's been automated. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Let me tell you a trade secret. Digital Dorothy who murmurs "two minutes to end of item" is, in fact, Fiona Bruce. We do obey. </unknownNode><unknownNode>Welcome to my new "ethical" blog. Now I'm not the most computer literate of people so I don't really understand the difference between this, an ethical blog, and my previous ethical diary.  </unknownNode><unknownNode>Ian - one of our online overlords - tells me that the important thing is that it will be easier for people to respond to the articles I post.  Sounds like a bit of a mixed blessing to me but here goes&hellip;</unknownNode><unknownNode>My latest Newsnight ethical film is on how lobsters can help save the world. Take a look and tell me what you think.</unknownNode><unknownNode>Newsnight's Justin Rowlatt has agreed to take part in an experiment for the programme - to live as ethical a lifestyle as possible for a whole year...</unknownNode><unknownNode>I've just been to the Quarterly Inflation Report press conference at the Bank of England. Last week they surprised the markets and raised interest rates to 4.75%. Today they gave a detailed account of the reasons and it brings no joy to mortgage payers but, maybe some to housebuyers. The bank's boss Mervyn King never gives "steers" about what future interest rates might do. But asked whether he might breach the 3% inflation benchmark, upon which he has to "write a letter" to Gordon Brown, he said it was 50/50 that it would happen in the next six months and odds on to happen over the next two years...</unknownNode><unknownNode> 						Continue reading "Your mortgage rate is going up...it's "odds on"" 					</unknownNode><unknownNode>The blog looks wierd today because it is being changed into a generic Newsnight Reporters' blog. I will still be writing for it but I have managed to, in theory, persuade my fellow correspondents and presenters - and even some of those shadowy characters who really run Newsnight, The Producers, to write for it. Like the old blog it's an experiment - largely driven by the success of Idle Scrawl and the need for Newsnight to stop using analog technology (aka Stuart and Ian the web team) to organise online feedback. We will probably experiment again in 6 months time, and as a regular Typepad user I am already having a go at Vox. I am told the blog will sort itself out and my fantastically sarky picture will be back for those who are already missing it.</unknownNode><unknownNode>As of today the Idle Scraw becomes "lo scarabocchio ozioso", joining the British chattering classes' exodus to the land of the above. I have packed my paints, a pencil, Tolstoy and some Montecristos -  but not the means to post regularly here. I am handing over to Stuart and Ian, the Newsnight web team, to do as they will with these pages....</unknownNode><unknownNode> 						Continue reading "Giotto, Giolitti, graft, Gramsci...." 					</unknownNode><unknownNode> 			The BBC is not responsible for the content of external internet sites 		</unknownNode><unknownNode>Talk about Newsnight is a blog from the BBC's flagship news and current affairs programme.
