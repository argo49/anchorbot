                                The Philippine Red Cross has estimated that more than 1,000 people have been killed in the coastal city of Tacloban and at least 200 in hard-hit Samar province when one of the strongest typhoons slammed into the country.
  Gwendolyn Pang, secretary general of the Philippine Red Cross, said on Saturday that the numbers came from preliminary reports by Red Cross teams in Tacloban and Samar, among the most devastated areas hit by Typhoon Haiyan on Friday.
      Almost all houses were destroyed, many are totally damaged. Only a few are left standing, but with partial damage

  "An estimated more than 1,000 bodies were seen floating in Tacloban as reported by our Red Cross teams," she told Reuters.
  "In Samar, about 200 deaths. Validation is ongoing."
  She said she expected a more exact number to emerge after a more precise counting of bodies on the ground in those regions.
  The Philippines has yet to resume communications with officials in Tacloban, a city of about 220,000 that suffered the worst of the typhoon.&#160;Reports say the sea flooded the entire city.
  It is a similar story in the town of Palo, further south. It is said to be under three and a half metres of water.
  One UN official said the damage was similar to the devastation caused by the Indian Ocean tsunami in 2004.
  A huge rescue operation is under way after the strongest storm to hit land since records began smashed into the Philippines, destroying most houses in a surge of flood water and high winds, officials said.
  The death toll and material damage estimates are&#160;expected to rise sharply as rescue workers and soldiers on Saturday&#160;reach areas cut off by the massive storm, now leaving the Philippines and heading towards Vietnam.
  
  The category 5 storm weakened after hitting six spots in the Philippines and has been downgraded to category 4, though forecasters said it could strengthen again over the South China&#160;Sea on its course to hit Vietnam on Sunday.
  Houses flattened
  "Bodies are lying on the street," said Captain John Andrews, deputy director general of the country's Civil Aviation Authority, citing a 5am message from a station manager&#160;who&#160;only makes contact every four hours to conserve battery power.
  He said the deaths were likely caused by huge waves whipped up by the typhoon,
  Before communications were cut on Friday, city officials had reported heavy flooding. Mobile phone networks, power lines and trees were toppled and most roads were cut off.
  "Almost all houses were destroyed, many are totally damaged.&#160; Only a few are left standing, but with partial damage," said Major Rey Balido, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, adding that severed communication links made it hard to fix casualties.&#160;
  In the island province of Capiz, at least&#160;six people were killed and&#160;10 missing, according to the provincial disaster response agency.
  As much as 90 percent&#160;of the houses and buildings in the province&#160;were also destroyed, according to national media.
  About a million people took shelter in 37 provinces after President Benigno Aquino appealed to those in the typhoon's path to leave vulnerable areas.
  Transports halted
  Another area of particular concern was Guiuan, a fishing town of about 40,000 people on Samar that was the first to be hit after Haiyan swept in from the Pacific Ocean.
  Meteorologists said the impact may not have been as strong as feared because the storm was moving so quickly, reducing the risk of flooding and landslides from torrential rain, the biggest causes of typhoon casualties in the Philippines.
  Ferry services and airports in the central Philippines remained closed, hampering aid deliveries to Tacloban, although the military said two C-130 transport planes managed to land at its airport on Saturday.
     
Andrews said the airport terminal was destroyed by the typhoon, which also blew off the roof of the airport tower in Roxas City in Capiz province to the west.
  At least two more people had been killed on the tourist destination of Cebu island, radio reports said.
  For the islands of Bohol and Cebu it is a second disaster in a month. They have been struggling to recover from an earthquake that killed more than 200 people just a few weeks ago.
  Haiyan was the second Category 5 typhoon to hit the Philippines this year after Typhoon Usagi in September. An average of 20 typhoons strike every year, and Haiyan was the 24th in 2013.&#160;
  
Last year, Typhoon Bopha flattened three towns in southern Mindanao, killing 1,100 people and causing damage of more than $1bn.
